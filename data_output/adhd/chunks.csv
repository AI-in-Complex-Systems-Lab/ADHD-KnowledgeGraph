Background: Because emotional symptoms are common in attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients
and associate with much morbidity, some consider it to be a core feature rather than an associated trait. Others
argue that emotional symptoms are too nonspeciﬁc for use as diagnostic criteria. This debate has been difﬁcult to
resolve due, in part, to the many terms used to describe emotional symptoms in ADHD and to concerns about overlap
with mood disorders. Methods: We sought to clarify the nature of emotional symptoms in ADHD by reviewing"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|0|6a39139b493549ff8e048e1247d0cb24
"with mood disorders. Methods: We sought to clarify the nature of emotional symptoms in ADHD by reviewing
conceptual and measurement issues and by examining the evidence base regarding speciﬁcity of such symptoms for
ADHD. We reviewed the various terms used to deﬁne emotional symptoms in ADHD, clarify how these symptoms are
demarcated from mood disorders, and assess the possibility that symptoms of emotional impulsivity and deﬁcient
emotional self-regulation should be considered as core symptoms. We addressed psychiatric comorbidities, the
effects of ADHD treatments on associated emotional dysregulation, and the utility of current rating scales to assess
emotional symptoms associated with ADHD. Results: Emotional symptoms are common and persistent in youth and
adults with ADHD. Although emotional symptoms are common in other psychiatric disorders, emotional impulsivity
(EI), and deﬁcient emotional self-regulation (DESR) may be sufﬁciently speciﬁc for ADHD to function as diagnostic
criteria. Conclusions: Emotional symptoms in ADHD cause clinically signiﬁcant impairments. Although there is a
solid theoretical rationale for considering EI and DESR to be core symptoms of ADHD, there is no consensus about
how to deﬁne these constructs sin a manner that would be speciﬁc to the disorder. An instrument to measure EI and
DESR which demarcates them from irritability and other emotional symptoms could improve the accuracy of"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|0|2a71bce1b84d4d178461bb61f6c2caa4

Introduction
Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a
common neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed by
symptoms of age-inappropriate inattention, hyper-
activity, and impulsivity that cause impairment in
two or more domains of daily life (Faraone et al.,
2015). Many iterations of the DSM since DSM-III
view emotional symptoms as an associated feature
supporting the diagnosis of ADHD. In contrast, in
descriptions of the disorder prior to DSM-III, emo-
tional symptoms had a prominent role in character-
izing ADHD youth (Barkley, 2015) and such
symptoms were core criteria of the Wender Utah
Criteria for adults (Ward, Wender, & Reimherr,
1993).
Despite recognition that intense, emotionally
charged behavior was common in ADHD, DSM-III’s
framing the disorder in terms of inattention and
under inhibited behavior de-emphasized affectivedisturbances and excluded them from diagnostic
criteria. Since then, however, research has only
strengthened the association between ADHD and
emotion-related problems. Forty to 50% of children
with ADHD have signiﬁcant impairments that stem
from rages, irritability, or other manifestations of"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|0|553bc87a53be4191ac697d82e6bdc4a0
"with ADHD have signiﬁcant impairments that stem
from rages, irritability, or other manifestations of
susceptibility to anger and low tolerance for distress
(Anastopoulos et al., 2011; Barkley, 2015; Barkley &
Fischer, 2010; Biederman et al., 2012; Karalunas
et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016; Shaw, Stringaris, Nigg,
& Leibenluft, 2014; Skirrow & Asherson, 2013;
Sobanski et al., 2010; Spencer et al., 2011). We will
refer to these collectively as ‘emotional symptoms’.
These symptoms are more prevalent in the combined
subtype (now called ‘presentation’ in DSM-5) of
ADHD compared with other subtypes and their
severity increases with the severity of other ADHD
symptoms (Sobanski et al., 2010; Vidal et al., 2014).
Emotional symptoms are also common among
adults with ADHD (Barkley & Fischer, 2010; Skirrow
& Asherson, 2013; Surman et al., 2011, 2013).

"models of ADHD that emphasize the inadequacy of
self-regulatory functions, some consider emotionalsymptoms integral to ADHD, rather than an associ-ated trait (Barkley, 2015; Barkley et al., 2000; Nigg& Casey, 2005; Sagvolden, Johansen, Aase, & Rus-
sell, 2005). On the other hand, emotional symptoms
are not speciﬁc to ADHD and are present variablyamong patients with the disorder (Copeland, Brot-man, & Costello, 2015; Stringaris, Cohen, Pine, &Leibenluft, 2009), casting uncertainty on the meritsof including them as a ‘core feature’ of ADHD.
Although there is substantial debate about the
nature of emotional symptoms in ADHD and
whether they should someday be incorporated into
the diagnostic nomenclature, there is little questionabout their importance. Many studies have shownthat such symptoms have a serious impact onpatients with the disorder. In a study of 358children aged 5 –12 years with ADHD, emotional
symptoms correlated with impaired social, dailyliving, and adaptive skills and were associated with
increased rates of treatment service utilization
(Anastopoulos et al., 2011). Children with ADHDand higher levels of emotional symptoms were ratedas less likeable by unfamiliar peers in playgroups(Lee et al., 2017). Higher levels of emotionalexcitability/impatience, lack of behavioral controlwith strong emotions and inﬂexibility/slow return tobaseline associate with parent and self-rated social
impairment in adolescents. (Bunford, Evans, &"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|1|b68e2ca1203648488658bf36f8d99ada
"impairment in adolescents. (Bunford, Evans, &
Langberg, 2018). Children with ADHD and emo-tional symptoms are more likely to have hyperac-tive/impulsive symptoms continuing into earlyadulthood as well as a lower likelihood that fullysyndromic ADHD will remit (Biederman et al.,2012). People with ADHD and emotional symptomshave signiﬁcantly lower quality of life, signiﬁcantly
worse social adjustment and reduced marital status
compared to those with ADHD and no emotionalsymptoms (Surman et al., 2013). Among peoplewith ADHD, emotional symptoms associate withunemployment, poor work performance and peerrelations, and being ﬁred or quitting work out ofboredom. Emotional symptoms associate with feweryears of schooling, decreases in the likelihood of
graduation from high school and college, and higher
rates of suspensions and expulsions from school.Patients with ADHD and emotional symptoms aremore likely to have had driver license suspensions,trafﬁc tickets and ﬁnancial problems than thosewithout emotional dysregulation (Surman et al.,2013).
Given the serious impact of emotional symptoms
on people with ADHD, the present review sought to
clarify the nature of these symptoms in ADHD. Weﬁrst review conceptual and measurement issues andexamine the evidence base regarding speciﬁcityof such symptoms for ADHD. We then evaluateimplications for both medical and psychologicaltreatments.Conceptual issues"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|1|d2c4396ce3c44b96a0492102d65b1b43
"One challenge to understanding the role of emotionalsymptoms in ADHD is the abundance of terms usedto describe them: emotional lability (EL), emotionalreactivity, emotional impulsivity (EI), emotionalinstability, emotional dysregulation, deﬁcient emo-
tional self-regulation, distress tolerance, frustration
discomfort and irritability. Approaching this issue byconsidering the time course, or ‘affective chronome-try’ (Davidson, 1998; Thompson, 1994), of thesedifﬁculties may better specify how people with ADHDshow emotion-related impairments that differ fromothers with other conditions who show emotionalsymptoms.
Phases of emotional expression: emotion
generation and regulation
While people with ADHD are prone to rapid, unusu-
ally intense, and disproportionate emotional reac-tions, the point at which emotional regulation
processes begin is a matter of some debate (Gross
& Barrett, 2011). It seems intuitive that to regulate
something it must already exist. By extension,emotion regulation would refer to the managementof one’s current emotional state after it emerges(Barkley, 2015; Etkin, B €uchel, & Gross, 2015; Shaw
et al., 2014). However, the emergence of emotionalstates also involves regulating processes (e.g., sen-sory gating, thresholds for stimuli to activate
emotion, anticipatory appraisal and valuation)."|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|1|5209537e502344aeb83e4d7649d3befe
"emotion, anticipatory appraisal and valuation).
Therefore, factors that regulate the onset of emotioncould well include those intended to preventunwanted emotional activation in the ﬁrst place orto raise the likelihood of experiencing desired ones(e.g., selection or modiﬁcation of situations, antici-patory self-preparation, external constraints andfacilitators) (Gross & Barrett, 2011). From that
standpoint, “ ...regulatory processes are develop-
mentally incorporated into emotion itself —both neu-
robiologically and behaviorally —leading some to
conclude that ‘unregulated emotion’ in any puresense does not exist, especially when an appropri-ately-inclusive conceptualization of emotion regula-tion is used” (Thompson, 2011, p. 53).
We can reconcile different connotations of ‘regula-
tion’ by distinguishing a narrow from a broad
meaning. Current research on emotional statesfrequently differentiates emotion generation (or acti-
vation) from regulation in which the emotional state
itself becomes the focus of controlling processes(Costa et al., 2014; Esslen, Pascual-Marqui, Hell,Kochi, & Lehmann, 2004; Gross & Barrett, 2011;Lindquist, Wager, Kober, Bliss-Moreau, & Barrett,
2012; Ochsner et al., 2009; €Oner, 2018; Waugh,
Shing, & Avery, 2015). To the extent that emotiongeneration is itself a regulated process, a broadmeaning of ‘regulation’ encompasses the array offactors through which problematic emotional states"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|1|df4a53231a1e4679a83e21bfee80178d

"arise and are managed. The narrow meaning empha-
sizes this latter, management aspect. To avoid con-fusion with other usage, we will use the term emotionregulation to refer to the regulatory processes thatoccur after the generation of emotion.
A temporal model for emotional symptoms
associated with ADHD
Barkley points out that those with ADHD are prone
to difﬁculties both with emotion generation that ishighly impulsive and with the self-regulatory func-tions that effectively manage emotional experience to
rein in behavior from accelerating to problematic
degrees (Barkley, 2015). He refers to the former as EIand the latter as deﬁcient emotional self-regulation(DESR). Mirroring the broader literature on emotion,these processes are distinguishable. In this frame-work, due to weak self-regulatory processes, emo-tionally reactive behavior can reach high levels andbe abnormally prolonged even if one’s initial emotion
is not pathologically intense. For example, the degree
of anger experienced by an ADHD driver faced with atrafﬁc incident may be the same as that for a non-ADHD driver. But while the non-ADHD driver cansoothe herself with self-regulatory mechanisms, theADHD driver cannot. Although emotional symptomsin ADHD often have a negative valence (e.g., irri-tability, anger), both EI and DESR are valence-free
terms. Consider, for example, the ADHD child that"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|2|7022e49dac6040bea6547ef80dd12488
"terms. Consider, for example, the ADHD child that
cannot stop himself from giggling in the classroom.His age-typical mates may experience the sameemotion, but their self-regulation skills lead to acovert smile rather than an explosive giggle.
Figure 1 shows our conceptual model of emotional
processing impairments in relation to ADHD. We usetwo terms deﬁned by Barkley (Barkley, 2015) as an
organizing principle. EI is shown as fast-rising (i.e.,
rapid onset), with unusually high reactivity inemotionally evocative situations, which leads toquicker-than-typical emotional responses to provok-ing stimuli (e.g., Barkley, 2015). EI is abrupt andsituationally provoked, not spontaneous. DESR, incontrast, occurs after emotion generation. DESRleads to a slower than typical return of activated
emotions to baseline. Theoretically, EI and DESR
could be caused by deﬁcits in the biological networksregulating emotions and the cognitive-behavioralskills needed to cope with such emotions, but thepresumptive speciﬁc underlying mechanisms maybe distinct.
Our model also addresses the fairly well-estab-
lished dyssynchrony between subjective emotional
experience and observed behavior, which may have"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|2|478240508df4460baaf6cd28eb634456
"Our model also addresses the fairly well-estab-
lished dyssynchrony between subjective emotional
experience and observed behavior, which may have
particular signiﬁcance for ADHD. There is an under-standable tendency to attribute greater anger to theindividual who is more belligerent or pleasurable toone who laughs more loudly. At the same time, itseems inappropriate to say that the stoic, unexpres-sive mourner is necessarily less grief-stricken thanthe sobbing one. In fact, the covariation among the
response systems that jointly constitute emotions –
subjective/cognitive, behavioral, and physiological –
varies greatly across individuals. Findings of weakconcordance between response systems for several
emotional states has been demonstrated in adults
(Lanteigne, Flynn, Eastabrook, & Hollenstein, 2014;Mauss, Levenson, McCarter, Wilhelm, & Gross,2005; Mauss & Robinson, 2009), and similar resultsare seen for children and adolescents (Benoit, Allen,Austin, Waldron, & Ollendick, 2015; Smith,Hubbard, & Laurenceau, 2011).
Discordance between behavior and subjectively
experienced emotion suggests that unusually
intense behaviors in the form of rage outbursts,aggression, or other conspicuous upsets do notnecessarily signify a commensurate rise in felt emo-tion. In ADHD, more extreme forms of behavioralexpression may in part reﬂect the behavioral disin-hibition inherent to the disorder. EI can be viewed asa special instance of a broader construct of impulsive"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|2|d9207df48d094890b2baf07a55fe882e

emotionally expressive behavior.
Each of the four infographics in Figure 1 show
the time course of emotional intensity after anemotionally activating stimulus. These infographicsseparate emotional intensity into subjective experi-ence (the red line) and behavior (the blue line).Trajectories reﬂect individual differences in pro-
cesses that (a) generate an emotional state, and (b)
regulate it after it emerges. Diagrams A through Dillustrate how they might produce both typical andcertain ADHD presentations that the next sectionsdescribe. These trajectories are presented as pro-totypes from which individuals will vary as onewould expect from the heterogeneous nature ofemotional symptoms in ADHD. Figure 1A presents
trajectories for the typical, non-ADHD person. The
generation of emotions in response to provokingstimuli is moderate and does not reach impairinglevels. Self-regulatory skills are sufﬁcient to bringemotions back to baseline quickly, and emotionaland behavioral trajectories are in synch with oneanother.

EI and high DESR. In this case, high EI leads to a

It contrasts with Figure 1A’sdepiction of a typical age mate whose reactions tothe same stimulus are developmentally appropri-ate: less extreme, slower to gather steam, andoverall better regulated. For high EI and high
DESR patients, we hypothesize that behavioral
responses are excessive for the level of emotionand rise more rapidly than emotional responsesduring episodes of EI. We hypothesize that theFigure 1B prototype would be associated with pre-dominantly hyperactive-impulsive and combined-type ADHD presentations.

"Figure 1C shows the case for patients with no EI

ated with primarily inattentive ADHD presentations.
Figure 1D shows a prototype of EL in ADHD. We
use the term emotional lability to refer to rapidchanges in emotional states (Graziano & Garcia,2016; Hulvershorn et al., 2014; Posner et al., 2013;Skirrow & Asherson, 2013). In our model, EL occursbecause onset of emotions is quick and impairing(due to high EI), but return to baseline is quick (due
to sufﬁcient self-regulatory processes). We hypothe-
size that the Figure 1D prototype would be associ-ated with primarily hyperactive-impulsive andcombined-type ADHD presentations.
Other approaches to the emotion-regulatory
processes disrupted in ADHD
Different frameworks for the speciﬁc processes
involved in emotion regulation tend to converge ona list of impairments that resembles those found inADHD (D’Agostino, Covanti, Monti, & Starcevic,2017; Ebner-Priemer et al., 2015; Etkin et al.,2015; Lindquist et al., 2012; Thompson, 2011). Inbroad terms, inadequate self-control and weakbehavioral inhibition are frequently cited sources of
emotional dysregulation. One might therefore expect"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|4|484de84801824d94bcae6f27581da75e
"emotional dysregulation. One might therefore expect
that poorly controlled emotionally driven behaviorwould be another casualty of the wide-ranging self-regulatory deﬁcits to which ADHD patients are prone(Nigg & Casey, 2005; Sagvolden et al., 2005; Bark-ley, 2015). Such frameworks are consistent with ourconceptual model. Several more speciﬁc processesthat are prominent in the literature on emotion
regulation also warrant comment in relation to
ADHD.
Some deﬁnitions of emotion regulation emphasize
processes that are under effortful self-control (e.g.,Shaw et al., 2014). These are self-regulatory skillsrequired to regulate emotions and which areimpaired by DESR. Other deﬁnitions incorporateexplicit processes such as reappraisal, diverting
one’s attention or distracting oneself, and suppres-
sion of outward signs of reactivity (Gyurak, Gross,& Etkin, 2011; Phillips, Ladouceur, & Drevets,2008). These are metacognitive activities in whichpeople with ADHD show demonstrable impairments(i.e., DESR). Gyurak et al. (Gyurak et al., 2011)examined adults’ success at employing thesestrategies as a function of performance on mea-
sures of executive function. They found that verbal
ﬂuency was associated with explicit emotion regu-lation. Adults with ADHD seem to be impaired onthis task as well as on set-shifting, which is alsonecessary to exert cognitive control over emotionalstate (Marije Boonstra, Oosterlaan, Sergeant, &Buitelaar, 2005).Several models include self-monitoring as a regu-"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|4|fbee94ee38894601adfb051d9a6456ad
"latory function, which is fundamental because earlydetection of looming emotional upset is a prerequi-site to timely deployment of an effortful strategy.ADHD often involves deﬁcits in self-monitoring
skills, resulting in low awareness of, among other
things, performance errors and emergent affectivearousal (Olvet & Hajcak, 2008; Shiels & Hawk,2010). Our model views self-monitoring as a skillset that can be applied to either EI or DESR.
One’s valuation or appraisal of a stimulus relative
to a desired state (is it ‘good’ or ‘bad’ for me)inﬂuences emotion generation; afterward, valuation
of the emotional state itself inﬂuences motivation to
suppress or amplify it (Etkin, Egner, Peraza, Kandel,& Hirsch, 2006; Gyurak et al., 2011; Ochsner &Gross, 2014). From this standpoint, high EI signiﬁesthat a person overvalues what he or she wants toattain or maintain, so that the negative affectobserved is disproportionate to the context. Prob-lems with down-regulating negative emotions would
stem from a determination that the desired outcome
is so valuable that it is worth the ‘cost’ of highdistress plus the consequences of the behavior thatresults.
Reappraisal is an essential element of effectively
managing emotionally evocative situations. Adultstry to do this explicitly with young children by, forinstance, telling them they will get to do the preferred
activity later, that something else enjoyable is on the"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|4|fcb0fbe908714da8b19c6e22bf3acc1b
"activity later, that something else enjoyable is on the
horizon, that sharing is highly valued by others(implying a social payoff), and so on. The cognitiveﬂexibility and motivation to see alternate outcomesas beneﬁcial depends on self-regulatory skills thatare impaired by DESR among those with ADHD.Such deﬁcits include those shown for reversallearning, perspective taking, and working memory.
These deﬁcits suggest that ADHD lowers one’s
capacity to re-evaluate goals and behavior. Thosewith ADHD may also attach anomalous valuations tocertain events so that they amplify emotional upsets.
Other models view emotional symptoms in the
context of distress tolerance (i.e., the ability towithstand aversive emotional states) (Leyro, Zvolen-sky, & Bernstein, 2010). In our model, distress
tolerance is a trait that tempers EI to avoid excessive
emotion generation. This is consistent with onestudy showing that distress tolerance separates outfrom factors of emotion regulation (Van Eck, Warren,& Flory, 2017). In their review, Leyro et al. (2010),following Trafton and Gifford (2011) describe dis-tress tolerance as a process regulated by the rewardsystem. In this view, distress tolerance is a ‘propen-
sity to respond to immediate (negative) reinforcement"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|4|4d53672ab07a41af9ee04344089829a5
"sity to respond to immediate (negative) reinforcement
or reward, as opposed to pursuing alternative rein-forcers that may become accessible when immediatenegative reinforcement is inhibited or not pursued’.This is especially relevant to ADHD given its associ-ation with exaggerated delay discounting. It is pos-sible that patients with ADHD prefer the immediate

"reward of a quick emotional response (e.g., relief of
distress) rather than the longer term rewards of self-regulation (e.g., not aggravating an already demand-ing situation).
Differentiating the emotional symptoms of
ADHD from the irritability of other disorders
The role of irritability in diagnosing disorders has
generated much debate. For a comprehensive reviewof this construct, see Brotman, Kircanski, andLeibenluft (2017). DSM-5 uses irritability as asymptom in several ways. Its mood criterion for a
manic episode can be met by a distinct period of
abnormal and persistent irritability if that periodlasts for 1 week, is present most of the day, nearlyevery day and co-occurs with abnormal and persis-tent goal-directed activity or energy. The irritabilityseen in bipolar disorder represents a time limitedepisode and a distinct break from the child’s usualmood. The mood criterion for a depressive episode
can be met by being irritable most of the day, nearly
every day for a 2-week period. When such episodesoccur in an ADHD patient, they are symptoms of amood disorder, not of ADHD. In contrast to the‘distinct periods’ that characterize mood disorders,the relatively brief episodes of EI and DESR weattribute to ADHD are not diagnostic of these otherdisorders even if irritability occurs.
The DSM-5 category of disruptive mood dysregu-"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|5|2a66266f7c884f4a815b08ab63fdce3e
"The DSM-5 category of disruptive mood dysregu-
lation disorder (DMDD) describes those who havefrequent ﬁts of rage and a persistently angry orirritable mood ‘most days, most of the time’ (Amer-ican Psychiatric Association, 2013). Although someADHD youth also have DMDD, the episodic ragesand persistent irritability of DMDD differ from theﬂashes of high emotional intensity followed by a
return to a euthymic ‘baseline’ that most children
with ADHD experience (e.g., Blader et al., 2016; Royet al., 2013).
The diagnosis of DMDD requires four mood
criteria: (A) severe, recurrent temper outbursts thatare out of proportion to the situation or provoca-tion; (B) the outbursts are inconsistent with devel-opmental level; (C) the outbursts occur three or
more times per week; and (D) the mood between
outbursts is persistently angry or irritable most ofthe day, nearly every day and is observable byothers. Although criteria A through C might beconfused with the dysregulation associated withADHD criterion D’s requirement for a persistentangry or irritable mood clearly demarcates ADHDfrom DMDD. In principle, there may be distinct
processes involved when a provocation quickly and"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|5|b9ccd713895b49e9944caa0ae1621b46
"processes involved when a provocation quickly and
profoundly alters one’s emotional state (as in EI)versus when it intensiﬁes an already negative mood(as in DMDD). In practice, distinguishing persistentnegative mood states that ‘smolder’ from those that‘ﬂare’ for briefer periods can be difﬁcult. DMDD’sweak reliability in ﬁeld trials may stem in part fromsuch uncertainties in parent reports (Regier et al.,
2013). The high comorbidity of DMDD with ADHDadds to this complexity.
In DSM-5, irritability is also diagnostic for oppo-
sitional deﬁant disorder (ODD) and is associated
with conduct problems, anxiety, autism spectrum
disorders, personality disorders, and intermittentexplosive disorder (Anastopoulos et al., 2011;Berkovitz, Eisenhower, & Blacher, 2017; Fettich,McCloskey, Look, & Coccaro, 2015; Sobanski et al.,2010). Table 1 describes clinical features that dis-criminate between emotional symptoms in ADHDand these potentially comorbid disorders. The cross-
disorder nature of irritability is seen in a study of 500
subjects with ADHD (Ambrosini, Bennett, & Elia,2013), which concluded that irritability in childrenwith ADHD increased the likelihood of comorbiditywith several disorders. Similarly, Mulraney et al.followed children with ADHD for 3 years, ﬁnding thatsigniﬁcantly more parent-reported irritability in theadolescents was predicted by earlier externalizing
problems (Mulraney, Zendarski, Mensah, Hiscock, &"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|5|12cf0472f8e84c1e81afb510b59cd230
"problems (Mulraney, Zendarski, Mensah, Hiscock, &
Sciberras, 2017). Persistent irritability was alsoassociated with increased severity of ADHD symp-toms and poorer functioning in multiple domains.
The above notwithstanding, it is important to note
that irritability in ADHD is not simply a conse-quence of mood disorder or another comorbidity.Geller et al. (2002) reported that 71.6% of subjects
with ADHD and no mood disorder displayed irri-
tability. Mick, Spencer, Wozniak, and Biederman(2005) found that 76% of ADHD subjects endorsedat least one irritability item from the ODD module ofthe Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders andSchizophrenia. However, greater severity of irritabil-ity, deﬁned as mad/cranky from the depressionmodule and super-angry/grouchy, cranky from the
mania module, was associated with a comorbid
mood disorder.
There exists evidence of a relationship between
anxiety disorders and irritability and between irri-tability and ADHD in clinical populations. Forexample, in a clinical study comparing AffectiveReactivity Index scores between groups of youthwith either no psychopathology, anxiety disorders,
bipolar disorder, or severe mood dysregulation,"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|5|24bb1c9b23174c5098aa2cde82ff1789
"bipolar disorder, or severe mood dysregulation,
Stoddard et al. (2014) found a clear relationshipbetween irritability and anxiety disorders. However,the relationship between anxiety and irritability inADHD youths is presently unclear and remainsunderstudied. In a study investigating the geneticunderpinnings of irritability using polygenic riskscores (PRS) in three separate cohorts with irri-
tability data (one ADHD sample and two epidemi-
ological samples), associations were found betweenADHD PRS and early irritability traits. Associationswith anxiety and mood disorders were not found,suggesting that childhood irritability in the popu-lation is associated more with ADHD than anxietyand mood disorders (Riglin et al., 2017).

"Evidence suggests that the emotional symptoms
of ADHD and the irritability of ODD are separateentities. Liu et al. (2016) studied 1,317 childrenand adolescents, 42.6% of whom had emotionallability and 39.4% of whom had ODD: 19.7% had
emotional lability only, 16.6% had ODD only, and
22.9% expressed both conditions. They concludedthat emotional lability is distinct from the ‘mood/affect sub-dimensions’ of ODD. It is also not clearthat irritability can be explained by the samemechanisms across both disorders. One hypothe-sis is that irritability in ODD is inﬂuenced byvulnerability for emotional disorders (mood and
anxiety) with attendant increase in exposure to
stressful negative life events (Eyre et al., 2017),and that irritability in ADHD is inﬂuenced bydeﬁcits in response inhibition to frustration (i.e.,low frustration tolerance) mediated by the pre-frontal cortex (Fischer, Barkley, Smallish, &Fletcher, 2005).
Because emotional symptoms are features of
many psychiatric disorders that co-occur with
ADHD, it is possible that the emotional symptomsof ADHD are simply epiphenomena of comorbidity.This issue has only been addressed by a handful ofstudies. Taken together, these studies indicatethat, although psychiatric comorbidity accountsfor some of the emotional symptoms associatedwith ADHD, there is an independent contribution
from ADHD symptoms both in predicting emotional"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|6|4a728a9f18964c7a8824e3e228b358e7

symptoms and functional impairments in multipleareas including occupation, education, legal, ﬁnan-cial, family life, and social relations (Barkley &Fischer, 2010; Skirrow & Asherson, 2013; Surmanet al., 2013).
The measurement of emotional symptoms
The different terms used to describe the emotionalsymptoms of ADHD are mirrored by a plethora ofrating scales for emotional symptoms. Our reviewfound 20 such measures that could be used in either
research or clinical practice (Table 2). We do notinclude behavioral tasks used to assess emotionalresponses in experimental settings. Currently, noone standard tool has been adopted by either the
clinical or research community. Most of the scales
adopt the concept of emotional self-regulation,whereas a few address-related constructs such asaffective reactivity, emotional lability, and theexpression of emotions. The degree to which thesescales measure the same or different constructs is,essentially, unknown.
The scales in Table 2 can be differentiated in
several ways. Four are intended for adults only,
eight are for children only, and eight for both.Most have a self-report version; some can beadministered by parents, teachers, or clinicians.Thirteen have been used in treatment trials, butnone has been validated as a patient-reportedoutcome using current criteria for clinical trials(Patrick et al., 2011a, 2011b). Eleven have popu-
lation norms; nine do not. The normed scales are"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|6|3f8b5e9364c94a7690a8bfb725f9a741
"lation norms; nine do not. The normed scales are
good screening tools because they can gauge howthe patient’s level of EI differs from that of ana v e r a g ep e r s o n .M o s to ft h es c a l e sa r ef r e e ;s o m erequire a fee. We know of no data to indicate thatthe free tools are better or worse than those thatr e q u i r eaf e ef o ru s e .
Most of the scales for emotion regulation were not
developed speciﬁcally for people with ADHD. Excep-
tions are: Conners Global Index Emotional LabilityScale (CGIELS) (Conners, 1997), the EmotionalLability scale on Conners Rating Scales-Revised(CSR-R) (Conners, 2001), and the Wender-ReimherrAdult Attention Deﬁcit Disorder Scale (Marchant,Reimherr, Robison, Robison, & Wender, 2013). TheConners scales focus on emotional lability, which
overlaps with emotional dysregulation. The remain-
ing scales are either measures of executive function-ing, emotional dysregulation broadly deﬁned, or abroader conceptualization of ADHD which includesTable 1 Clinical features that discriminate between emotional dysregulation in ADHD and other childhood psychiatric disorders

The Distress Tolerance (Simons & Gaher, 2005)

Effects of ADHD treatments on emotional
dysregulation
Medical treatment
Two recent meta-analyses of pharmacotherapy on
emotional dysregulation in adults with ADHDdemonstrate some improvement in emotionaldysregulation, but these effects were not as large
as those demonstrated for core ADHD symptomswith medical treatment. A meta-analysis of ninestudies which examined methylphenidate (MPH) or
atomoxetine (ATX) in treating emotional dysregula-
tion in adults found that the medications had apositive effect which was in the moderate rangeand lower than for ADHD symptoms (Moukhtarian,Cooper, Vassos, Moran, & Asherson, 2017). Allmedication effects were analyzed together, so theefﬁcacy of MPH versus ATX for emotional dysreg-ulation cannot be compared. In addition, the
analyses did not address whether the effects of
treatment were equivalent for the two medicationsor primarily carried by one or the other. A subse-quent meta-analysis (Lenzi, Cortese, Harris, &Masi, 2018) included 21 studies; additions wereTable 2 Rating scales developed to measure emotional symptoms

"more recent studies, as well as data from unpub-
lished studies by investigators and/or drug com-panies. The authors also analyzed the effects ofseveral medications separately. The effect size (ES)for MPH and lisdexamfetamine (LDX) was small-to-
medium (each SMD =0.34), while the ES for ATX
was small (SMD =0.24). Again, these authors
found weaker effects of the treatments on emo-tional dysregulation than on core ADHD symp-toms. Although the results from the meta-analysesare encouraging, the effect sizes are low comparedwith the effects of the same medications on ADHDsymptoms. This could be due to the inadequacies
in measures of emotional regulation, to the exis-
tence of substantial heterogeneity among ADHDpatients in the expression of these symptoms or todifferent dose requirements for the different com-ponents of the disorder.
Stimulant medications. Several studies of children,
adolescents, and adults with ADHD and emotional
dysregulation demonstrated that extended-release
methylphenidate preparations signiﬁcantly improvedmeasures of emotional lability; these studies weresummarized by Childress and Sallee (2015). Masiet al. (2016) demonstrated lower aggression and emo-tional dysregulation scores on the CBCL in 8 –12-year-
oldchildrenwithDisruptiveBehaviorDisorders(DBD)and ADHD. Peyre, Speranza, Cortese, Wohl, and
Purper-Ouakil (2015) noted in their sample that the

"Purper-Ouakil (2015) noted in their sample that the
Child Behavior Checklist –Dysregulation Proﬁle was
not associated with a poorer response of ADHD symp-toms to MPH or to increased adverse effects. Anadditional clinical study of the effect of MPH onemotional dysregulation among 7 –13-year-old chil-
dren with ADHD +ODD or conduct disorder showed
that treatment with MPH over 1 year was effective in
improving emotional dysregulation symptoms signif-
icantly, independent of both the positive effects from aparent behavior management program and the degreeof improvement in the children’s ADHD symptoms(Kutlu, Akyol, & Ercan, 2017). The latter ﬁnding isconsistent with the interpretation that emotionalsymptoms in ADHD are not solely attributable to theother core symptoms of the disorder.
Using data from two trials in which children with
ADHD and severe aggressive behavior receivedcarefully optimized stimulant monotherapy beforerandomization to adjunctive medications if aggres-sion did not remit, Blader et al. (2016) reported thatstimulant treatment alone led to remission ofaggressive behavior in almost two thirds of patients.The likelihood of remission was not diminished by
the presence of persistent negative mood symptoms,"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|8|f7e32786cd4b41148d32e49d48345fd6
"the presence of persistent negative mood symptoms,
and these symptoms also improved signiﬁcantly.Other work shows that stimulant monotherapyleads to high rates of remission of irritability amonghighly volatile, aggressive children with ADHD. Thisﬁnding is consistent with the possibility thatimproved impulse control mediates improvements
in emotional regulation (Blader et al., 2013).
R€osler et al. (2010) conducted a 24-week, double-
blind, randomized controlled trial (DBRCT) ofextended-release MPH. This extended-release MPH
was superior to placebo in reducing emotional
symptoms associated with ADHD in adults. Reim-herr, Marchant, Gift, Steans, and Wender (2015)assessed two distinct categories of adults withADHD: those with a high Inattentive Factor, andthose with a high Emotional Dysregulation Factor.Over two long-term clinical trials with extended-release MPH, emotional dysregulation was acutely
responsive to MPH treatment, and symptoms con-
tinued to improve during 6-month open-label follow-up periods. Another study demonstrated that adultswith ADHD in group cognitive psychotherapy orindividual counseling plus MPH treatment hadsigniﬁcantly better scores on measures of impulsiv-ity and emotional lability after 24 and 52 weeksthan those in psychotherapy/counseling plus pla-
cebo (Philipsen et al., 2015).
There have been fewer studies with amphetamine"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|8|a9e2bfefe35d42a9a7b3daf2f3f194d2
"cebo (Philipsen et al., 2015).
There have been fewer studies with amphetamine
formulations. A post hoc analysis of an open-label,7-week, dose optimization study of lisdexamfe-tamine dimesylate (LDX) in three hundred andsixteen 6 –12-year-old children with ADHD found
that 53% of the subjects met predetermined criteriafor ‘emotional control impairment’ at baseline, but
only 20.7% met these criteria after treatment with
LDX (Katic et al., 2013). Additional analyses foundthat children treated with either extended-releaseMPH or LDX demonstrated signiﬁcant decreases inoverall functional impairment, including improve-ments in family and social activities, suggestingbetter emotional self-regulation (Banaschewskiet al., 2013). A subsequent, post hoc analysis of a
double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects
of LDX on emotional dysregulation in children withADHD found that there were signiﬁcant improve-ments in emotional lability in children having themost severe emotional lability scores at baseline.However, in this stratiﬁed group of children withADHD and severe emotional lability, there was ahigh percentage of patients who experienced irri-
tability as a treatment-emergent adverse event (Chil-
dress et al., 2014). Interestingly, in the MultimodalTreatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA),irritability measured as an adverse effect of ADHDtreatment (primarily with stimulants) improved withtreatment (Fern /C19andez de la Cruz et al., 2015)."|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|8|325e3bafd9bb44d7952104e75b663808
"There are a few studies of emotional dysregula-
tion and ADHD treatment in adults, and the
ﬁndings are generally consistent with studies in
children. Moderate improvements have been foundin the Emotional Control subscale of the BehaviorRating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Ver-sion Self-Report (BRIEF-A) Behavioral RegulationIndex after a 10-week trial of LDX (Adler et al.,

"2013). Thus, amphetamines, although less well-
studied than MPH for emotional dysregulation, doappear to be effective for the treatment of adultswith ADHD and emotional dysregulation.
Table 3 summarizes the methodology, sample size,
and results of these studies.
Nonstimulants. A meta-analysis of all pediatric
ADHD studies (N: ATX =2,449; placebo =1,479)
found small positive effects of ATX on child emotion-ality (Schwartz & Correll, 2014). In subgroup anal-yses, small improvements in ODD symptoms alsowere noted, although this ﬁnding has beeninconsistent across studies with ATX (Biederman,
Wigal, Spencer, McGough, & Mays, 2006).
Reimherr et al. (2005) re-examined the data from
two double-blind, randomized controlled trials(DBRCT) of ATX in adults with ADHD, looking
speciﬁcally at the response of ‘emotional dysregula-
tion’ symptoms to ATX versus placebo as measuredby the Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention DeﬁcitDisorder Scale (WRAADDS), deﬁned as problemswith ‘temper, affective lability and emotionalover-reactivity’; emotional dysregulation symptomsimproved signiﬁcantly more in ADHD patients takingATX than placebo.

Behavior management training for parents, chil-
dren, and teachers. Parent Behavior Management
Training (PBMT) programs teach positive parentingand helpful child behavior management strategies,initially using praise and incentives to inﬂuence thechild’s behavior, based on operant conditioningprinciples. One such program, the Incredible Years(IY), offers training about establishing predictablehome routines, social coaching, and teaching emo-
tion regulation and problem-solving strategies to
children. Signiﬁcant parent-reported improvementsin the children’s emotional regulation were noted atthe end of the 16 –20-week program (Trillingsgaard,
Trillingsgaard, & Webster-Stratton, 2014). PBMTmay be especially helpful for preschoolers withsymptoms of both ADHD and ODD. (Forehand et al.,2016; Sanders & Mazzucchelli, 2013). Although
there is strong evidence for the efﬁcacy of PBMT
programs for disruptive behaviors in general, fewpublished reports assessed emotional dysregulationoutcomes after PBMT in preschoolers with ADHD.
Graziano and Hart (2016) reported a study of
preschoolers with externalizing behavior problemswho were exposed to one of three interventions: an 8-week School Readiness Parenting Package (SRPP), or"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|10|a58e222830ba47fd830c69e00cd10f3e
"the SRPP plus one of two intensive, pre-kindergarten(pre-K) summer treatment camp program modules.The ﬁrst module offered a behavior modiﬁcationsystem and a pre-K academic curriculum (STP-Pre-
K); the second offered STP-Pre-K and a social-
emotional and self-regulation training program(STP-Pre-K Enhanced). Children in the summerprogram with the social-emotional training moduledemonstrated better emotion knowledge, emotionregulation and overall executive functioning com-pared with children in the other two groups. Gainswere sustained at 6 months.
Cognitive-behavioral and metacognitive thera-
pies. Cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) differ
from PBMT in drawing attention to the role thatone’s thoughts and feelings can have on behavior,helping individuals to become aware of these and toaddress distortions in thinking, feelings and expec-tations so that they do not adversely inﬂuence
behavior. One promising new treatment for young
children with ADHD and emotional dysregulation isdirected play-based metacognitive executive func-tion training, developed by Tamm and colleagues(Tamm, Nakonezny, & Hughes, 2014). In a small,proof-of-concept study, the parents of 3 –7-year-old
children with ADHD attended eight weekly instruc-tional sessions, with concurrent sessions for the
children; parents and their children were taught a"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|10|1890ca5f5e8f4a2e86e132b032f3aa93
"children with ADHD attended eight weekly instruc-tional sessions, with concurrent sessions for the
children; parents and their children were taught a
set of games and activities designed to improve avariety of executive functions, such as attention,inhibition, and memory (Tamm & Nakonezny, 2015).Signiﬁcant improvements in parent-rated children’sbehavior, including normalization of BRIEF EmotionRegulation ratings, were seen at the end of theintervention, compared to a waitlist control group of
children with ADHD.

Piasecka (2016) recently reviewed CBT in childrenand adolescents, focusing particularly on those withirritability, anger problems and/or aggression,trans-diagnostically. They noted that children andadolescents with ADHD often have such problems,which may reﬂect ADHD with emotional dysregula-
tion; thus, ADHD patients may beneﬁt from CBT that
focuses on emotion regulation and cognitive reap-praisal. Because controlled trials are lacking, wecannot draw any conclusions about the efﬁcacy ofthese CBT methods for emotional dysregulationissues in youth.

"emotion regulation, coping skills for managing
anger, and problem-solving after modulating emo-tions. For integrative treatment, children met ingroup therapy while parents met together in simul-taneous treatment sessions. The comparison group
was assigned to community psychosocial care; 60%
received some mental health services during thestudy. Parental satisfaction with the IntegrativeTreatment program was quite positive. The clini-cians’ mean ratings of mood severity improved forthe integrative group among those who attendedmost sessions (ES =0.53). Irritability ratings
improved during treatment but worsened signiﬁ-
cantly in the 6-week post-treatment follow-up
period. Despite face validity, it is not yet knownwhether ADHD patients with ED but without SMDwould ﬁnd this program more effective than theother combined (medical & nonmedical) treatmentsdescribed above.
Manualized CBT group and individual therapy
programs have been developed for adults with
ADHD, most of whom are treated with ADHD med-
ications but still have residual symptoms. However,few investigators have examined whether this treat-ment has beneﬁt for emotional dysregulation. Twosmall studies have shown promise for treating emo-tional dysregulation with a combination of CBT anddialectical behavior therapy (DBT) (Cole et al., 2016;Nasri et al., 2017). Nasri et al. (2017) found signif-

Mindfulness techniques. Mindfulness meditation
is often regarded as a method of enhancing self-regulation and moderation of emotions and impulses.The current state of research in mindfulness-basedapproaches for individuals with ADHD was reviewed
by Mitchell et al. (Mitchell, Zylowska, & Kollins,
2015). Schoenberg et al. (2014) postulated thatchanges in event-related potentials (ERPs) in adultswith ADHD after a 12-week course of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) might reﬂectimprovements in both ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’emotional regulation. A small pilot study of an 8-weekmindfulness meditation group training for adults with
ADHD (Mitchell et al., 2017) improved impulse con-
trol and access to emotion regulation strategies.Although these preliminary results suggest somepromise for mindfulness-based treatments for adultswith ADHD, large controlled studies are needed beforeone can draw ﬁrm conclusions.
Discussion
Our review of emotional symptoms in ADHD hasexamined conceptual and measurement issuesalong with the evidence base regarding speciﬁcityof such symptoms for ADHD. We also evaluatedimplications for both medical and psychologicaltreatments. Although ADHD has often been consid-
ered a disorder of cognitive and executive functions,emotional symptoms are highly prevalent. Thesesymptoms are associated with higher levels ofimpairment in youth and adults with ADHD. They"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|11|5c8234d5904a4fa386fac0e708cc63a0
"predict a more pernicious course and are only
partially responsive to treatments for ADHD.Although emotional symptoms occur in other psy-chiatric disorders, the emotional symptoms of ADHDcannot be adequately accounted for by the presenceof comorbidity in individuals with ADHD.
Emotional symptoms are currently considered to
be associated features of ADHD –much like learning
problems or executive dysfunction. They are not
diagnostic for the disorder. Yet our conceptualmodel, which extends Barkley’s, 2015 framework,supports the idea that symptoms of EI and DESRshould be considered when diagnostic criteria arerevised. From a theoretical perspective, it seemsodd that impulsive and poorly regulated cognitionand behaviors are criteria for ADHD, but impulsive
and poorly regulated emotions are not. That said,
the ﬁnding that emotional dysregulation is presentin only a subset of individuals with ADHD, therecognition that emotional dysregulation also existsin individuals without ADHD, and the lack of aconsensus on how to measure emotional dysregu-lation, are formidable challenges to be consideredbefore changes in diagnostic criteria can be consid-
ered.
Re-evaluation of the current diagnostic criteria
requires clariﬁcation of measurement issues andreﬁnement of the measures themselves. AlthoughEI and DESR have a big impact on the functionalstatus and treatment outcomes in youth and adultswith ADHD, current screening and measurementtools are based primarily on assessment instru-"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|11|571c44e151ff4105a473c0fda97bb80b
"ments for ADHD and mood disorders. This is a
signiﬁcant problem, because there are several com-ponents of emotional symptoms and different termsused to describe them. Accordingly, there is a needfor a new measurement tool/assessment instru-ment that captures the multidimensional nature ofemotional symptoms. Creating such a measurewould help identify emotional symptoms in the
context of ADHD, delineate boundaries between
ADHD and other disorders and improve the mea-surement of changes with treatment. Because emo-tional symptoms are also a prominent feature ofother psychiatric disorders in children and adults,more accurate identiﬁcation and description of EIand DESR would beneﬁt the psychiatric ﬁeldbeyond ADHD.
When criteria for disorders are selected, speciﬁcity
is one of many considerations. If a symptom com-monly occurs in other disorders, its diagnostic utilityfor ADHD may be limited. Emotional symptoms,broadly deﬁned, are clearly not speciﬁc for ADHD.For example, it would be a mistake for future

"diagnostic criteria to include irritability as a criterion
for ADHD. The more narrowly deﬁned constructs ofEI and DESR may be sufﬁciently speciﬁc (Surmanet al., 2011), but more work is needed to betterdeﬁne and select such symptoms.
When considering whether emotional symp-
toms are part of the core disorder in ADHD, wemust keep in mind that few symptoms in psy-chiatry are completely speciﬁc. The reliabilityand validity of diagnoses derives from the use ofpolythetic criteria, each of which may lack com-plete speciﬁcity (Cooper , Balsis, & Zimmerman,
2010). In fact, current trends emphasize trans-
diagnostic phenomena that arise from shared
components of etiology (Cuthbert, 2015). Newmolecular genetic data are quite clear in con-ﬁrming results from epidemiologic studies indi-cating substantial overlap among psychiatricdisorders as regards causal genomic loci (Smol-ler et al., 2018). Likewise, others have suggestedthat shared mechanisms among disorders
should be key treatment targets (Green, 2017;
Marchette & Weisz, 2017).
The treatment data both support and augment the
points made above. Both medical and nonmedicaltreatments show some efﬁcacy for treating the emo-tional symptoms of ADHD. Yet the efﬁcacy of thesetreatments is relatively weak compared with theefﬁcacy of similar treatments for managing the
symptoms of ADHD. The efﬁcacy results could be"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|12|84877ffd825849a693aa51ae0192bb5e
"symptoms of ADHD. The efﬁcacy results could be
due, in part, to the measurement issues discussedabove. With other factors held constant, a measurewith low reliability will show lower efﬁcacy than onewith higher reliability. Researchers and cliniciansmust also consider that there may be much hetero-geneity in emotional symptoms among patients withADHD. No study ﬁnds that all patients exhibit
emotional symptoms. Thus, there is heterogeneity
about whether emotional symptoms are present ornot and, if present, heterogeneity about the nature ofthe symptoms. Such heterogeneity makes it difﬁcultto offer diagnostic or treatment guidelines, especiallygiven the measurement issues that remain to beresolved.
The capacity for emotion regulation transcends
speciﬁc emotional states. However, there is some
debate whether these regulatory processes inﬂu-ence the range of emotional states associated withemotional valence or speciﬁc disorders (Becerra,Preece, Campitelli, & Scott-Pillow, 2017; Lannoyet al., 2014; Lavender et al., 2017). The timing ofemotion-related phenomena seems to vary forspeciﬁc valences (Lindquist et al., 2012; Waugh
et al., 2015). For instance, neural activation to
stimuli eliciting disgust and fear occur faster thanfor anger and happiness, and sadness is slower still(Costa et al., 2014). However, among those withADHD, inadequate management of emotionalexperience and expression for both positive and"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2018 Emotional Dysregulation.pdf|12|d8dfb9aef4ac4e87afb05fd59bda79d4
"negative emotions often poses difﬁculties, leadingsome to view their emotional symptoms as a globaltrait (e.g., Barkley, 2015). Further study of thisissue may contribute to more precise delineation of
the contributions of generalized emotional under-
control versus more selective ampliﬁcation of cer-tain emotional states for subgroups of patients. Itwill also have crucial implications for the develop-ment of therapies aimed at teaching self-regulatorystrategies.
We conclude by encouraging broader recognition
of the importance of emotional symptoms in
individuals with ADHD and recommend that EI

We call for multidisciplinary efforts to bettercharacterize the speciﬁc nature of EI/DESR inADHD, the similarities and differences betweenEI/DESR in ADHD and other disorders, elucida-tion of the neurobiology underlying this construct,
and investigation and/or development of treat-
ments that speciﬁcally target these emotionalsymptoms.

anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder).  The symptoms do not occur 
exclusively during the course of  schizophrenia or another psych otic disorder. 
Subtypes 
The DSM-5 identifies three s ubtypes of ADHD based on the predom inance of symptoms: 
1. Predominantly Inattentive Presentation : Enough symptoms of inattention, but not 
hyperactivity-impulsivity, are pres ent for the past six months.  
2. Predominantly Hyperactive -Impulsive Presentation : Enough symptoms of 
hyperactivity-impulsivity, but not  inattention, are present for  the past six months. 
3. Combined Presentation : Enough symptoms of both i nattention and hyperactivity-
impulsivity are present fo r the past six months. 
Severity 
The DSM-5 also specifies  the severity of ADHD: 
 Mild : Few, if any, symptoms in exce ss of those required to make the  diagnosis are 
present, and symptoms result i n no more than minor impairments in social or 
occupational functioning. 
 Moderate : Symptoms or functional impairm ent between ""mild"" and ""severe""  are present. 
 Severe : Many symptoms in excess of thos e required to make the diagnos is, or several 
symptoms that are particularly s evere, are present, or the symp toms result in marked 
impairment in social or o ccupational functioning.

and organizational structure and/or  systems that are relevant t o the provision of high-quality health care.  We describe the f irst phase of

follow-up of adults with ADHD.  T his will fill an  important gap  in the field of Adult ADHD bec ause QMs for adult ADHD do not e xist.  
Methods  We followed the guidelines of t he US Agency for Healthcare Res earch and Quality (AHRQ) for  the development of QMs. 
These guidelines call for two phases: 1) Identify Candidate QMs  and 2) Assess Candidate QMs.   T his article describes the resu lts of

 Background:  
Quality measures (QMs) (also k nown as Quality Indicators) quant ify healthcare processes, outco mes, patient perceptions, and 
organizational structure or syst ems that are relevant to the pr ovision of high-quality health car e.  They are increasingly bei ng used by 
the US Agency for Health Resear ch and Quality (AHRQ), Medicare and Medicaid.  With the implementat ion of the Affordable Care A ct, 
QMs have become vital for mana ged care organizations, insurance  companies and other organizatio ns tasked with monitoring quali ty 
and determining reimbursement r ates for services (Nigam, 2012).   QMs are intended to improve th e delivery of care, identify fa ctors 
leading to favorable outcomes, r educe variations in care leadin g to poor outcomes and point the fi eld in the direction of best  practices 
(Patel  et al. , 2015).  To define a QM , one creates a ratio of objective meas ures.  For example, in primary care a QM used for controlling 
hypertension is: “The percentage  of clinic members 18-85 years of age who had a diagnosis of hyp ertension and whose BP was 
adequately controlled during the measurement year based on the following criteria: 18-59 = <140/9 0 mm Hg;  60-85 w/ diabetes =  
<140/90 mm Hg;  60-85 w/ o diabetes = <150/90 mm Hg  (National C ommittee for Quality Assurance, 2018).   
 QMs are not practice guidelines . Whereas practice guidelines ar e comprehensive algorithms for scr eening, diagnosis and treatme nt,"|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|2|30768ca5fcc8444f980858f29ba31d46
"QMs are not practice guidelines . Whereas practice guidelines ar e comprehensive algorithms for scr eening, diagnosis and treatme nt, 
QMs only cover key aspects of p ractice that can be documented w ith objective measures.  They onl y track the most essential fea tures 
of health care delivery (National  Committee for Quality Assuran ce, 2018, Patel  et al. , 2015).  QMs cannot be as  detailed as practice 
guidelines.  If they were, health care professionals would be un duly burdened.   
 
QMs are typically based on evidenc e from the research literatur e and expert opinion.  They should be feasible to measure and s hould 
focus on one of the following aspe cts of health care: improving  safety or efficacy, being respons ive to patient preferences, n eeds and 
values, reducing delays in diagno sis and treatment and conservi ng resources.  QMs address four l evels of health care delivery:  
1) Systems level events (e.g., t he ratio of providers to patien ts in a practice); 2) Provider behaviors (e.g., use of an ADHD screening 
instrument) 3) Intermediate patie nt outcomes (e.g., adherence t o treatment) and 4) Desired pat ient outcomes (e.g., percent of 
responders to a treatment regime) .  Within each of these domain s, QMs will track, not only approp riate practices, but also ina ppropriate 
or overused practices (AHRQ, 2011).

Discussion 
 
As our literature re view documented, this work is the first ste p toward defining quality measur es (QMs) for the diagnosis and treatment 
of ADHD in adults. By convening a panel of content experts, rev iewing published guidelines for t he diagnosis and treatment of ADHD, 
and surveying additional experts , we generated a short list of QMs that should be considered in monitoring clinical practice i n primary 
care and specialty clinics. 
 
The list of items extracted from  the guidelines literature was longer than the list of items gener ated by the brainstorming se ssion.  This 
result was expected because gui delines are meant to be comprehe nsive whereas QMs are meant to co ver essential aspects of pract ice 
that can be documented with obj ective measures (Patel  et al. , 2015, Quality, 2014).  Moreover , when QMs are used by healthc are 
organizations and insurance progr ams only a handful of the most  important are implemented so a s not to unduly burden healthcar e 
professionals (Patel  et al. , 2015, Quality, 2014).  The lar ger list of QMs generated by th is project could evolve into guidelines if a 
consensus is achieved by expert clinicians.

"Our survey of experts yielded a clear bimodalit y in the degree to which the QMs were rated as b eing important, reliable/valid and 
feasible/usable (Figure 3D).  B efore focusing on the top-rated QMs, one must understand a key point from Figure3D.  All QMs re ceived 
ratings above average (3.0) whi ch indicates that all could play  a role in quality care and, p erhaps, should be considered when  creating 
treatment guidelines. 
 Examination of the t op ten QMs (Table 4), based on these rating s is instructive.   We generated  QMs in six domains: screening,  
diagnosis, treatment Initiation , treatment follow-up, care coor dination and the patient experie nce.   None of the QMs generate d for care 
coordination and the patient exper ience landed in the top ten l ist.  As Supplemental Table 1 sh ows, all the QMs in these domai ns 
received mean scores of 4.0 or lo wer, which is in the bottom ha lf of the distribution (See Figure  3D).  This view from experts  is 
consistent with the extant gui delines literat ure; we found none  that addressed these two domain s.   We can only speculate as t o why 
this pattern occurred.  One possi bility is that the quality of care coordination and the patien t experience are distal events.    In the

 The screening and diagnosis items  on the top ten list suggest t hat experts are concerned about t he possibility of false positi ve 
diagnoses of ADHD (e.g., items doc umenting use of DSM-5 criteri a, especially impairment) and ab out assessing for comorbidity ( e.g., 
items regarding other d isorders).  The items chosen from the tr eatment initiation section all pertain, to some degree, with th e risk for 
adverse events.  QMs regarding m edication choice, referral to p sychosocial treatment, medication misuse and others received lo wer 
ratings.  The maxim “first do no harm” seems to have guided exp ert opinion here.  The top items in the treatment follow-up sec tion seek 
to assure that follow-up takes pl ace and that clinicians assess  treatment efficacy with a validated measure.   
 
Comparing the top ten QMs for adult ADHD with pr eviously publis hed QMs for childhood ADHD is also instructive, keeping in mind  that 
none of the experts involved in this project had seen the list of the childhood QMs prior to thei r participation.  There are n o extant child 
QMs for screening in healthcare  settings, suggesting that clini cians may rely on the screening role provided by the educationa l system.  
Only three screening measures wer e generated by our project and  only one reached the top ten fo r adult QMs (% high risk patien ts 
screened).  The limited emphasis on screening by experts whose clinical populations are usual ly pre-screened by referral is"|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|4|6b3d683e38f9412ca204ef545d3691b0
"screened).  The limited emphasis on screening by experts whose clinical populations are usual ly pre-screened by referral is 
understandable.  Prior and curren t surveys of psychiatrists and  PCPs about their preferences in diagnosing and assessing adult  ADHD 
found that psychiatrists expressed a lower need for screening f or ADHD than PCPs (Adler  et al. , 2009, Silverstein  et al. , 2017).  The 
low emphasis on screening for t he adult QMs also differs from o ther mental health conditions suc h as depression and substance abuse, 
where screening has become standar d in many settings. This may reflect higher participation o f PCPs in the formulation of the standard 
of care for depression and subs tance abuse, as well as limited data on the populati on benefits of screening for ADHD in adults .   
 
For the diagnosis domain, both  the child and adult QMs call for  documenting DSM criteria along w ith impairment.  The only chil d QM for 
treatment initiation is about e stablishing a care management pl an.  In like manner, the adult QM s indicate the need to conside r 
treatment alternatives but they a lso focus on assessing vital s igns and contraindications to d rug treatment.  There are three adult QMs 
for follow-up among the top ten.   These three QMs appear on the  child QM list.  Our top 10 QM o nly address non-pharmacologic 
treatment in one QM (% patients receiving ADHD medications for whom treatment alternatives, benefits and risks have been"|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|4|a8e4244d430d4bde82c317497c77f7e3
"treatment in one QM (% patients receiving ADHD medications for whom treatment alternatives, benefits and risks have been 
discussed). The de-emphasis of non- pharmacologic treatments may  reflect concerns about accessib ility of such treatments (e.g.,  
cognitive behavior therapy), thei r limited evidence base (e.g.,  working memory training, most supp lements) and their relative newness 
compared with pharmacotherapies. 
 
The list of QMs in Table 4 is no t a final list for implementati on in clinical practice.  Instead , it gives the starting point for the next phase of 
this project which will incorpor ate the views of stakeholders a nd then field test the QMs in clin ical settings.  Nevertheless,  clinicians 
should view the current list of QM s as a starting point for def ining what is essential in scr eening, diagnosing and managing A DHD in 
adults."|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|4|481adc076847421ca9d8108a32c5bf0a

"Guidelines for Treating ADHD in Adults 
Screening  
 Screen for symptoms of ADHD  
 Increase awareness about high-ri sk populations (e.g., prisoner s, individuals born prematurely).   
 Administer & score World Health O rganization's Adult Self Repo rt Scale (ASRS-V1.1, 18 item)  
 Developmental Screen: Patient must fulfill the criterion of ag e 12 childhood onset.  
 Impairment Screen: Are these sy mptoms causing difficulty in yo ur life right now?  
Diagnosis  
 Adults with impairing symptoms of ADHD without a childhood dia gnosis of ADHD, should be referred to 
specialist   
 Adults previously treated for ADHD with impairing symptoms of ADHD should be referred for adult 
psychiatric services assessment.   
 Evaluation of adults presenti ng with ADHD symptoms typically r equires 2 or more visits.  
 Age-appropriate presentations o f symptoms should be considered  when evaluating adult ADHD symptoms  
 Evaluate current ADHD symptoms  using rating scales with adult norms.   
 Obtain a physical examination to eliminate medical causes.   
 Diagnosis based on self-report only is acceptable; collateral information is desirable.   
 Some symptoms and functional im pairment need to have been pres ent in patients prior to age 12.   
 For a diagnosis of ADHD, symptom s of H-I and/or IA should: (1)  meet DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria, (2) be 
associated with impairment based on interview and/or direct obs ervation in multiple settings, and (3) be 
pervasive, occurring in 2+ settings."|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|7|cf782a16543b489783837bd6dd578022
"associated with impairment based on interview and/or direct obs ervation in multiple settings, and (3) be 
pervasive, occurring in 2+ settings.  
 Only consider patients  with at least moderate impairment in 2 different settings for m edication treatment.   
 Symptoms should meet DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria and be associat ed with at least moderate impairment in 
multiple settings.    
 ADHD diagnosis requires: (1) meets DSM-5 symptom criteria; (2)  developmental history consistent with 
ADHD & childhood symptoms of ADHD;  (3) past & current pattern o f impairment consistent with ADHD; 
(4) no other disorder explains the symptoms.   
 Severity should be measured and based on the number and severi ty of ADHD symptoms/b ehaviors, presence 
of psychiatric comorbidity, leve l of impairment, including perv asiveness (e.g., occurrence in ≥ 2 important 
settings)    
 ADHD diagnosis should not be made solely on the basis of ratin g scale or observational data. However, such 
scales are valuable adjuncts. Use observations if unsure about symptoms.    
 Maternal alcohol use during pre gnancy should be included in an  evaluation for ADHD.  
 Some of the unique characteris tics of hypersexual patients may lead to the misdiagnosis of adult ADHD."|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|7|c12a5e4e669640a9b186f4988dd9baf1
"ADHD symptoms can be the result of stressful and unpredictable environment rather than being symptoms of 
ADHD.    
 A timetable of onsets for excessi ve substance use compared wit h onset of ADHD symptoms can help 
differentiate ADHD symptoms a nd substance induced symptoms.  
 A careful screen for cardiac  issues, early dementia, arthritis , obesity, poor dental hygiene, glaucoma, 
traumatic brain injuries and in juries for accidents is crucial.  
Treatment Initiation  
 Refer to psychiatrist for: extreme dysfunction, suicidality, h omicidality, substance abu se, psychosis, extreme 
psychosocial stressors, past treatment failures, atypical prese ntations.  
 Consider psychotherapy for drug treatment resistant patients a nd those well motivated for this approach. CBT 
is the preferred approach.   
 Psychosocial interventions shoul d be considered, especially co gnitive behavior therapy.    
 Address comorbid or alternative psychiatric conditions prior t o ADHD treatment. Milder disorders may be 
deferred.   
 Treatment selection (medication or psychosocial interventions)  should consider severity, context of symptoms 
and impairment, patient age, p references, capabilities, and per sonal circumstances of the patients, 
parents/caregivers.  Can combine treatments.  
 Drug treatment should be started only under the guidance of a psychiatrist, nurse prescriber specializing in 
ADHD, or other clinical prescriber with training in the diagnos is and management of ADHD."|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|8|b0a9484a594045dcb879cf0100d5303b
"ADHD, or other clinical prescriber with training in the diagnos is and management of ADHD.   
 Drug treatment should always form part of a comprehensive trea tment program that addresses psychological, 
behavioral and educational or occupational needs.   
 Before initiating medication, pe rform a physical examination i ncluding BP, pulse, weight and height. 
 Document adequate assessment, p ast psychosocial treatments, & previous drug treatments before initiating 
stimulant treatment.    
 Before starting drug treatment, complete a: 1) mental health &  social assessment, 2) history & physical 
examination, 3) ECG if past medi cal or family history of seriou s cardiac disease, or abnormal findings on 
cardiac examination, 4) risk assessment for su bstance misuse and drug diversion.    
 Assess risk for potential substance misuse and drug diversion when prescribing stimulants. Not necessary for 
non-stimulants, which have no abuse potential.   
 Monitor for signs of diversion and misuse of stimulant medicat ion, especially for young adults. 
 The risks of abuse, misuse and diversion can be reduced by use  of long-acting formulations of MPH or 
AMPH. The prodrug LDX has a very low abuse potential and is a g ood alternative to immediate-release 
amphetamines.    
 Prescribers should be familiar with the requirements of contro lled drug legislation governing stimulant 
prescription."|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|8|73dd9fb372774987bbdd72cbbeb038ee
"In patients with ADHD and substa nce use disorder, ADHD treatme nt with stimulants should not be withheld, 
but rather postponed until problem atic substance use stops and t here is a commitment to the treatment process.   
 Drug treatment for patients who misuse substances should be pr escribed by an appropriately qualified 
healthcare professional with expe rtise in managing both ADHD an d substance misuse.   
 Stimulants contraindicated in patients with history of illicit  stimulant use, unless trea ting in a controlled or 
supervised setting.   
 Current or previous substance abuse can be seen as either a co ntraindication for stimulant prescription, 
especially immediate release prep arations, or as a reason for e xtremely close monitoring of a patient’s 
stimulant use.    
 For patients at high risk of s ubstance abuse, consider establi shing a drug contract or conducting periodic drug 
screens.    
 Abstinence is not an absolute precondition to start treatment,  but substance use must be stabilized.
 Use of cannabis is not necessarily a contraindication to presc ribing stimulant medication. 
 Prescribers should be familiar with the pharmacokinetic profil es of all long-acting and immediate-release 
preparations to ensure treatment is tailored effectively.   
 Drug treatment should be the firs t-line treatment unless patient prefers psychological treatment.  
 Stimulants are the first line of drug treatment for ADHD."|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|9|a628dce5a7c84325a21b981b1d1b3c3a
"Stimulants are the first line of drug treatment for ADHD. 
 Longer-acting forms of stimulan ts and nonstimulants improve co nvenience and extend control of ADHD 
symptoms in challenging environments.   
 Medication trials should usually  begin with stimulants and pro ceed to non-stimulants in the case of non- or 
poor response or intolerable AEs.   
 If starting drug treatment, try MPH first. 
 ATX or DEX should be considere d in adults unresponsive or into lerant to an adequate 6-week trial of MPH. 
Exercise caution when prescribi ng DEX to those likely to be at risk of stimulant misuse or diversion.   
 Antipsychotics are not recommended. 
 Prior to ATX treatment, previous history of liver disease shou ld be evaluated.  
 Genetic variants affect metabolism of ADHD medications.
 Treatment with stimulants requi res careful titration over 4 to  6 weeks due to marked individual differences in 
final dose.    
 During titration, gradually increase doses until no further im provement and side effects are tolerable. 
 Dose titration should be slower if tics or seizures are presen t. 
 If using MPH: (1) Begin initial treatment with low doses; incr ease dose according to response, (2) Give long-
acting preparations 1x daily and no more than 2x daily; Give im mediate-release preparations up to 4x daily, 
and (3) long-acting forms may in crease adherence or reduce risk  for substance misuse or diversion."|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|9|2b081264e34a462a895eeb24b091f177
"If using DEX: (1) Begin initial treatment with low doses (5 mg  2x daily); increase dose according to response 
up to a maximum of 60 mg/day, (2) give treatment in divided dos es between 2-4x daily, and (3) long-acting 
forms may increase adherence o rreduce risk for substance misuse or diversion.    
 If using ATX: (1) weight up to  70 kg, initial total daily dose  should be ~0.5 mg/kg; inc rease after 7 days up to 
~1.2 mg/kg/day, (2) > 70 kg, in itial total daily dose should be  40 mg; increase dose after 7 days up to a 
maintenance dose of 100 mg/day , (3) usual maintenance dose is e ither 80 or 100 mg, may be taken in divided 
doses, (4) allow 6-week trial on a maintenance dose to evaluate  full effectiveness    
 Give patient written informati on about local and national supp ort groups and voluntary organizations. 
 Give patient information about ADHD at every stage of their ca re.
 Review with the patient current  empirical research from clinic al trials with ADHD adults.
 Explore patient’s apprehensions (e.g., “This is a crutch,” ""St imulants are addictive"").
 Involve families in the treatment process
 Stress the value of a balanced d iet, good nutr ition and regula r exercise.
 Prior to a stimulant trial assess cardiac risk factors.    
 Check pulse and blood pressure prior to prescribing any ADHD m edication.

"Treatment 
Follow-up     
 Schedule follow-up appointments at least monthly until the pat ient’s symptoms have been controlled
 At each follow-up visit review: (1) diurnal variation in sympt oms; (2) target symptoms, job/school 
performance, relationship issues;  (3) adherence to therapy, dru g side effects/toxicity or signs of 
abuse/diversion; (4) vital signs   
 Regularly monitor medication response to treatment & titrate d oses to control symptoms, reduce impairment 
and other behavioral targets, wh ile minimizing adverse events.   
 Regularly monitor adverse even ts, blood pressure, pulse, weigh t, illicit substance use , & medication diversion 
 A pulse rate consistently above 120/min should signal a cardia c review; occasional extra beats are not 
necessarily a cause for concern, but persistent tachycardia nee ds investigation.    
 For stimulants: check blood  pressure and pulse quarterly. 
 For stimulants, a sustained res ting tachycardia, arrhythmia or  systolic BP of greater t han the 95th % (or a 
clinically significant increase) measured on two occasions shou ld prompt medical referral and dose reduction.   
 Side effects of drug treatment for ADHD should be routinely mo nitored and documented.    
 Systematically assess adverse ev ents by asking about known sid e effects. 
 Consider dose reduction if there  are troublesome side effects.
 Monitor sexual dysfunction and dysmenorrhea as potential side effects of ATX."|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|10|a8726e0ebba7491da0c0dcf78e9b1504
"Observe those treated with ATX for agitation, irritability, su icidal thinking, self-harming behavior, and 
unusual changes in behavior, particularly during the initial mo nths of treatment, or after a change in dose. 
Warn patients of rare potential liver damage.  
 If psychotic symptoms emerge f ollowing the introduction of sti mulants, ATX should be considered.    
 Do not give stimulants to a pa tient with an active psychotic d isorder.
 If stimulants cause anxiety, low er the dose and/or combine tre atment with an antidepressant; switching to 
ATX may also be effective.   
 Follow-up with patients on medi cations regularly to determine if continued treatment is warranted and if 
effectiveness continues.    
 Continue drug treatment if clinically effective & reviewed at least annually.  Evaluate effects of missed doses, 
planned dose reductions, and peri ods of no treatment. Drug holi days may be useful to assess treatment 
continuation need.    
 Maintain medication if it remains clinically effective and is reviewed annually 
 Assess long term benefits, especi ally if continuing treatment from childhood.  Consider medication 
discontinuation if warranted.   
 Use ADHD rating scales with the patient as a psychoeducational  tool.   
 Help patients find observational anchors they can use to self- monitor progress. 
 For those stabilized on medication but with persisting functio nal impairment or no response to drug treatment, 
consider cognitive behavior therapy"|data_input/adhd_2/Quality Measures for Adult ADHD.pdf|11|91c70bebe884466bb621857a60da6df6

"INITIAL TREATMENT  
Preference for combination medication and CBT — We suggest first -line treatment with a combination 
of medication and cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting executive dysfunction for most adults 
diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This is particularly true in individuals 
with severe executive dysfunction (algorithm 1 and algorithm 2). (See ""Attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder in adults: Psychotherapy"", section on 'Overview of management of  ADHD in adults'.)  
 
Both stimulant medication [4 -7] and CBT [8 -10] have been reported to be effective treatments for ADHD 
in adults. However, there have been no clinical trials in adults directly comparing the efficacy of CBT and 
medication separately and in combination. Therefore, we rely on studies that conducted these 
comparisons separately. Medication clearly augmented the benefit of CBT in one randomized, 
controlled, adequately powered study [11]. Five studies have assessed the benefits of adding CBT t o 
medication, with four studies reporting positive results [12 -15] and one study reporting negative results 
[16]. However, none of these studies included a control for nonspecific effects of psychotherapy. 
Nevertheless, these results strongly suggest that the combination of stimulant medication and CBT is 
better than either treatment alone.  
However, we modify the initial treatment for specific populations such as individuals with substance use"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|0|8ccdb7f4e98d4b1ea9505cba528f4d2b
"better than either treatment alone.  
However, we modify the initial treatment for specific populations such as individuals with substance use 
disorder (SUD) or other co -occurring disorders. (See 'Initial tr eatment for specific populations' below.)  
 
Additionally, for individuals with contraindications to medication, or in those who prefer not to take 
medication or engage in CBT, we use the patient preferred treatment as monotherapy. (See ""Attention 
deficit hy peractivity disorder in adults: Psychotherapy"".)  
 
Stimulants as preferred pharmacologic treatment — For most adults with ADHD, we suggest first -line 
pharmacologic treatment with a stimulant medication (eg, amphetamines or methylphenidate) rather 
than nonst imulant medications such as atomoxetine or antidepressants. An advantage of stimulant 
medication is that they have a clinical effect almost immediately after starting, while atomoxetine and 
the antidepressants have a delayed onset of full therapeutic actio n of up to four weeks, related both to 
the titration of the medication and the delay in the onset of action of the agent [17].  
 
There are no direct comparisons between stimulant and nonstimulant medications in clinical trials. 
Meta -analyses have shown that  effect sizes in short -term trials of adult ADHD are greater for stimulants 
compared with nonstimulant medications, including atomoxetine and atypical antidepressants"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|0|ced37beaa8a34d6b840793e371a3a37c
"compared with nonstimulant medications, including atomoxetine and atypical antidepressants 
(bupropion, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], and venlafaxine) [4 -7]. As an example, in a  meta -analysis of 
11 trials including 1991 adults with ADHD, pooled effect size for stimulants was somewhat greater 
versus placebo than for nonstimulant medications (Cohen’s d = 0.67 versus 0.59, respectively) [5]."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|0|c23a1118731343ff9554da3565e9def6
"Choosing a stimulant — Among the stimul ant medications, our first choice is typically an amphetamine 
rather than methylphenidate. Within each of these groups there are various formulations without 
established superiority in efficacy. Our choice is based on the properties of the medication (eg, half-life, 
time to onset) and prescriber familiarity and preference.  
 
●Amphetamines – Amphetamine stimulants include dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine, and 
can be short - or long -acting [18]. Amphetamine medications for ADHD are available in immediate - and 
extended -release formulations and have an onset of action of 20 to 60 minutes. The immediate -release 
formulation of dextroamphetamine -amphetamine has a duration of up to 6 hours [19,20]. Longer -acting 
formulations may last up to 10 to 12 hours [19 -22]. 
 
●Methylphenidate/dexmethylphenidate – Methylphenidate stimulants contain dexmethylphenidate or 
racemic mixtures of methylphenidate [21,23,24] and are either short -acting (3 to 5 hours), intermediate -
acting (4 to 8 hours), or long -acting (8 to ≥12 hours) . In addition to oral formulations, a methylphenidate 
patch is available and should be applied two hours before needed because of a delay in the onset of 
clinical effects.  
 
While amphetamines and methylphenidate have long been considered comparably efficac ious for adult 
ADHD, some data appear to show a benefit of amphetamines in reducing core symptoms of ADHD (eg,"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|1|42864a95c5f448339b3ad085d14733ad
"ADHD, some data appear to show a benefit of amphetamines in reducing core symptoms of ADHD (eg, 
inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) compared with methylphenidate. In a network meta -analysis of 
51 medication trials including 8131 adults with ADHD, after 12 weeks of treatment, individuals treated 
with amphetamines showed greater effect on clinician rating scales of overall ADHD symptoms than 
methylphenidate (standardized mean difference -0.29, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.05) [7]. However, 
amphetami nes were associated with higher risk of treatment ending early as the result of adverse 
events. No differences in efficacy were seen between higher and lower doses of amphetamines.  
Long - versus short -acting stimulants — Our choice of stimulant preparation is based on the patient’s 
preference, time to onset and length of desired effect, concern about misuse or diversion, cost, and 
availability of the medication. Some adults value the ability to target the short -acting drugs’ coverage to 
the desired part(s) o f the day (eg, time in class or at work). Others prefer the simplicity of the longer -
acting stimulant’s all -day or most -of-the-day coverage (table 1).  
 
Studies suggest that longer -acting stimulants may be less likely to be abused or diverted [25 -27]. A low er 
abuse potential for long -acting compared with short -acting stimulants is based on studies 
demonstrating greater subjective responses and potential reinforcement for immediate -release"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|1|e80769186017459ca99a1c2d7444328a
"demonstrating greater subjective responses and potential reinforcement for immediate -release 
stimulants compared with extended -release methylphenidate in healthy a dults [27].  
Despite pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic differences in stimulants used to treat adult ADHD, there 
does not appear to be differences in efficacy between short - and long -acting stimulants [4,7]."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|1|1871f6b4fae2436c9b5c6cd442511d19
"Pretreatment evaluation and contraindications — Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant in adults, 
we review their cardiovascular history including history of chest pain, palpitations, syncope, myocardial 
infarction, arrhythmia, valvular disease and their family history.  
We measure blood pressure and pulse in all patients and obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) in 
individuals with cardiac history or cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or chest pain. In individuals 
with a cardiac history, or when findings are outside of normal limits are seen, we co nsult with a 
cardiologist to determine whether the findings are sufficiently severe to avoid these medications [28].  
Dose and titration — We typically begin treatment with a low dose of the chosen agent and increase 
weekly while monitoring for clinical res ponse, duration of the effect during the day, and side effects 
(table 1). (See 'Monitoring' below and 'Defining response' below.)  
 
●For short -acting dextroamphetamine -amphetamine, we begin at 5 mg orally in the morning on the first 
day. If tolerated, we in crease to 5 mg twice a day (approximately at breakfast and lunch; eg, four hours 
between doses) beginning on the day 2 to 7. We monitor for improvement (see 'Monitoring' below) in 
symptoms for one week. If adequate improvement is not seen, we increase by 5  mg at weekly intervals 
until clinical response is adequate, intolerable adverse effects limit further titration, or maximum total"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|2|8140b86d4940414686f2217fa8835a11
"until clinical response is adequate, intolerable adverse effects limit further titration, or maximum total 
daily dose limit reached (60 mg).  
 
●For short -acting methylphenidate, we typically begin with 10 mg orally in the morning. If initial dose is 
tolerated, we increase to 10 mg at breakfast and lunch each day on day 2 to 7. Depending on response 
to medication, we increase by 10 mg at weekly in tervals until clinical response is adequate, adverse 
effects limit further increases, or maximum daily dose is reached (60 mg).  
●For long -acting dextroamphetamine -amphetamine (mixed salts), we typically begin at 10 mg orally 
each morning. If there are no a dverse effects after three or four days, we increase to 20 mg once per 
day in the morning. We increase by 10 mg at weekly (or longer) intervals until clinical response or a dose 
of 40 mg per day is reached. Doses above 40 mg per day are rarely necessary an d require close 
monitoring.  
 
Benefits of stimulant treatment  
●Symptomatic improvement – Stimulant medications have been shown to offer symptomatic 
improvement (particularly in attention and on -task behaviors) as well as improvement in daily 
functioning (vo cational and interpersonal performance) in adults as compared with placebo [5,7,18,29 -
32]. 
●Driving and work performance – Although evidence of positive effects on long -term psychosocial 
outcomes is limited, observational studies have found benefits from s timulant medication on"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|2|700528fb3149493fbcb83e4f60697e19
"outcomes is limited, observational studies have found benefits from s timulant medication on 
functioning, self -esteem, and work performance [33]. Additionally, while previous studies have found 
that individuals with ADHD are more likely to be involved in a motor vehicle collision compared with 
individuals without the disorde r, treatment of ADHD with medications lowers the risk of collisions"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|2|c40291aed2614e6b805a243e0eba4e02
"[34,35]. A cohort study of 2,319,450 patients diagnosed and treated for ADHD in the United States 
compared the risk of a motor vehicle collision in ADHD patients during months when they we re and 
were not receiving ADHD medication [36]. Males and females had a lower risk of a collision when 
receiving ADHD medication, by 38 percent (odds ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.56 -0.67) and 42 percent (odds ratio 
0.58, 95% CI 0.53 -0.62), respectively. (See ""Atte ntion deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: 
Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)  
 
●Duration of effect – Clinical trials have primarily focused on short -term effects (eg, 12 weeks) of 
stimul ant medications. These trials have consistently shown positive short -term effects.  
 
●Lower all -cause mortality – Among those diagnosed with ADHD, initiation of treatment medication 
appears to be associated with lower all -cause mortality at two -year follow -up, particularly for death due 
to unnatural causes (suicide, accidental injury). In an observational study including nearly 149,000 
individuals with ADHD (age at diagnosis 11 to 29 years; median age 17.4 years) treatment with ADHD 
medication as compared wi th noninitiation of medication, was associated with lower all -cause mortality 
(hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.7 -0.88) and lower “unnatural” cause of mortality (eg, suicide, accidental"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|3|9f92067d4aae44be9264bab906136eaa
"(hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.7 -0.88) and lower “unnatural” cause of mortality (eg, suicide, accidental 
injury, accidental poisoning [hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.66 -0.86]), but no t with natural cause of 
mortality [39]. (See ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, 
assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Mortality rates'.)  
 
Adverse effects — Stimulant medications are generally well tolera ted when taken as directed. Side 
effects of stimulants reported in adults treated for ADHD include dry mouth, insomnia (particularly if the 
duration of medication effects extends into the evening or if the medication is taken late during the 
day), irritabi lity, dysphoria, diminished appetite, weight loss, and headaches [40]. Nontherapeutic 
effects such as euphoria or elevated mood may lead to misuse of medications. Additionally, 
exacerbation of existing motor and vocal tics, as well as new onset of tics, ha s occurred. In a meta -
analysis of clinical trials, 10 percent of adults with ADHD treated with stimulant medications 
discontinued the medication due to adverse events [41].  
 
Other effects that may be seen in individuals treated with stimulant medications i nclude:  
 
●Psychosis – Psychosis has been reported in individuals who misuse or take excessive amounts of 
stimulant medication and may be an indication that a stimulant is being misused."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|3|1f98ce70f4f646f0ae7a271a293a0f0d
"stimulant medication and may be an indication that a stimulant is being misused.  
 
Some, but not all studies, report that in individuals with vulnerabil ity to psychosis (eg, comorbid 
schizophrenia, schizotypal personality disorder, mood disorder with psychosis, history of amphetamine 
induced psychosis), treatment with psychostimulant medications may increase the risk of psychosis"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|3|1eecfc2cf0c04ece936d3f2c2e15ee7e
"[42,43]. Otherwise, psych osis appears to be rare in clinical samples of adults with ADHD receiving 
stimulant treatment.  
 
●Mania – In a study of data from national registries in Sweden, treatment -emergent mania was found to 
be associated with the initiation of methylphenidate treat ment in adults with co -occurring bipolar 
disorder and ADHD; however, this association was seen only in patients who were not taking a mood 
stabilizing medication [44]. (See 'Bipolar disorder' below.)  
 
●Cardiovascular effects – Consistent elevations in syst olic and diastolic blood pressure (3 to 5 mmHg) 
and heart rate (five beats per minute) have been reported to result from stimulant treatment of ADHD 
in adults. The increases appear to be correlated, in part, to dose [45]. Longer -term data on the 
cardiovasc ular effects of these medications in adults suggest that these effects do not diminish over 
time. Research on the relationship between treatment with stimulants and cardiac disease or cardiac 
events has found mixed results:  
 
The following studies support t he association between use of medications for the treatment of ADHD 
and the risk of cardiovascular disease [28,46,47]:  
 
•In a case -control study of over 278,000 individuals (age 6 to 64) with ADHD, longer cumulative duration 
of medication for ADHD as compa red with nonuse of medications was associated with a greater risk of 
cardiovascular disease diagnosis [46]. As examples:"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|4|15d9422c4a2045b0ae04db9e16964383
"cardiovascular disease diagnosis [46]. As examples:  
 
-At 1 to ≤2 years use, as compared with nonuse, the risk of cardiovascular diseases is adjusted odds ratio 
1.09 (95% CI 1.01 -1.18).  
 
-At >5 years of use, as compared with nonuse, the risk of cardiovascular disease is adjusted odds ratio 
1.23 (95% CI 1.12 -1.36).  
 
While the association was reported for stimulant medication for up to five years, for nonstimulant 
medications the association  was for less than 1 year only. The strongest associations with any 
medication for ADHD at five years as compared with nonuse were for hypertension (odds ratio 1.8, 95% 
CI 1.6 -2.1) and arterial disease (odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 0.96 -2.3).  
 
•A retrospective a nalysis of 43,999 patients newly treated with methylphenidate, matched to nonusers 
of methylphenidate, found a 1.8 -fold increase in sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia. The absence of"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|4|6ea7491eacb84d25b36b46abe0bd9e87
"a dose -response relationship suggested that the association between t he medication and cardiac events 
may not be causal [28].  
 
However, these studies did not find an association:  
 
•In a meta -analysis of observational studies, an association between treatment for ADHD with stimulant 
or nonstimulant medications and the risk o f cardiovascular disease (ie, hypertension, ischemic heart 
disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, venous thromboembolism, tachyarrhythmias, and 
cardiac arrest) across age groups was not supported [48]. Pooled adjusted relative risks between ADHD 
medication use and any cardiovascular disease was 1.04 (95% CI 0.43 -2.48; (seven studies, n >850,000) 
and 1.59 (95% CI 0.62 -4.05; six studies, n >267,000 subjects) in young/middle -aged adults and older 
adults, respectively.  
•A retrospective, population -based cohort study of over 150,000 patients treated with 
methylphenidate, amphetamine, or atomoxetine did not find an association between stimulant 
treatment and the risk of sudden cardiovascular events among young and middle -aged adults [49].  
●Priapism – Priapism is a rare complication of methylphenidate stimulants in adult males, adolescents, 
and boys [50 -52]. Fifteen cases with a median age 12.5 years (range 8 to 33 years) were reported to the 
US Food and Drug Administration over a 15 year period [53]. Two cases required surgical treatment."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|5|b408b4ccae9b47599528911b8057fb2f
"US Food and Drug Administration over a 15 year period [53]. Two cases required surgical treatment. 
Priapism has also been reported among four patients taking amphetamine stimulants [53]; causation is 
uncertain as these patients were taking other medications thought to cause priapism. The diagnosis and 
treatment of pria pism are discussed in a separate topic. (See ""Priapism"".)  
●Potential for misuse or addiction – Prescription stimulants are subject to misuse, dependence, and/or 
diversion. Misuse of prescription drugs, including stimulants, is reviewed in detail separately . (See 
'Substance use and alcohol use disorder' below and ""Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, 
prevention, identification, and management"".)  
In studies of adults receiving stimulants for ADHD, stimulant treatment does not appear to affect the 
likelihoo d of subsequent SUD development, neither increasing SUD risk nor having a protective effect. A 
meta -analysis of 15 longitudinal studies that compared patients with a history of stimulant -treated 
ADHD to matched cohorts without stimulant treatment found no association between stimulant 
treatment history and subsequent substance use, abuse, or dependence [54]. In a national United States 
survey, 8.9 percent of the participants with a prescription for ADHD medication reported to have sold, 
traded, or given awa y their medication [55].  
However, individuals with recent or current substance use disorders ( SUDs ) are believed to be at higher"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|5|d47710d2306a4ba59b5d791165174411
"However, individuals with recent or current substance use disorders ( SUDs ) are believed to be at higher 
risk of misuse [56,57]. (See ""Alcohol use disorder: Treatment overview"" and ""Stimulant use disorder: 
Treatment overview"" and ""Opioid use disorder: Treatment overview"".)  
 
Counseling on low -risk and risky alcohol use — We cautio n individuals treated with stimulants for ADHD 
about simultaneous consumption of alcohol and stimulants. We recommend these individuals limit their"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|5|82654b278a214b7eb1305f242af62ce0
"alcohol use to one to two drinks after the expected therapeutic effects of the simulant have likely ended 
(ie, in the evening after morning stimulant administration). Prior use of alcohol may have clinically 
significant interactions with a number of subsequently administered stimulant drugs, including 
methylphenidate [58] and effects on the medications’ pharmaco kinetic and/or pharmacodynamic 
properties [58] through the production of new psychoactive metabolites [59].  
 
Alternatives to stimulant medications  
 
Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors — Atomoxetine [60] and viloxazine are nonstimulant medications 
that inhib it reuptake of norepinephrine. These agents have minimal abuse potential and appear to be 
efficacious in adult ADHD; however, indirect comparison of effect sizes in clinical trials suggest that 
stimulant medications are more effective [4,6,7]. (See 'Stimul ants as preferred pharmacologic 
treatment' above.)  
 
●Atomoxetine – Atomoxetine is an effective medication for adult ADHD with little to no abuse potential 
and is not universally classified as a controlled substance [61].  
 
We typically begin treatment with atomoxetine at 40 mg given once daily either in the morning or 
evening. We increase to 80 mg daily after three or four days if the medication is tolerated. We then 
monitor for an additional four weeks and if the effect is not sufficient we increase to the maximum dose"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|6|e6706c5e21634e54bbe8aa64615c1070
"monitor for an additional four weeks and if the effect is not sufficient we increase to the maximum dose 
of 100 mg per day. If adequate improvement is not seen after another four weeks, trial of another 
medication is indicated.  
 
The most common side effects observed with atomoxetine have included dry mouth, insomnia, nausea, 
decreased appetite, c onstipation, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, urinary hesitancy, dizziness, 
and sweating [62]. Aggressive behavior or hostility, and the emergence of psychosis or mania may be 
associated with treatment with atomoxetine [63]. In a six -month trial, pa tients discontinued medication 
treatment due to adverse events at a higher rate in the atomoxetine compared with the placebo group 
(17.2 versus 5.6 percent) [64].  
 
Atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It is metabolized primarily throu gh the 
hepatic cytochrome P450 system, through the 2D6 enzyme. There have been reports of hepatoxicity in 
two patients taking atomoxetine, with both patients recovering upon discontinuation. Atomoxetine can 
produce QTc prolongation in some individuals. (Se e ""Cardiac evaluation of patients receiving 
pharmacotherapy for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"", section on 'Pretreatment clinical 
evaluation'.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|6|20e1a6f99f994272855b61a3326f22cd
"Although there is a “boxed warning” for atomoxetine in youth under the age of 25 regarding suicidal 
behavior, no similar behaviors have been reported in studies of adults with ADHD.  
 
Analyses of multiple clinical trials have found atomoxetine, as compared with placebo, to reduce core 
ADHD symptoms (eg, inattention, hyperactivity) as well as improve executive functioning and quality of 
life in adults.  
 
Longer -term efficacy (six months or longer) has been reported for atomoxetine, as compared with 
placebo, fo r other outcomes such as executive functioning and quality of life [64,67]. Additionally in an 
uncontrolled trial including 125 individuals with atomoxetine for ADHD, a mean symptom reduction of 
30 percent on the Connors’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale -Investigat or Rated: Screening Version was 
maintained over a mean of 221 weeks [68].  
 
●Viloxazine – Viloxazine is a nonstimulant medication that acts via selective inhibition of norepinephrine 
and serotonin reuptake and is approved for treatment of children and adult s with ADHD [69,70]. In a 
trial, 50 patients (35 of them children), were treated with four weeks of atomoxetine (mean dose 60 
mg/day; range 25 to 100 mg/day), followed by a five -day washout period, then treatment with 
Viloxazine ER (mean dose 300 mg per da y; range 100 -600 mg/day) [71]. After four weeks, treatment 
with viloxazine ER, as compared with atomoxetine, was associated with greater reduction in core ADHD"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|7|286d0192ddc2457fb58f90b38163dc7f
"with viloxazine ER, as compared with atomoxetine, was associated with greater reduction in core ADHD 
symptoms, as well as fewer side effects, and a preference of 96 percent for continued treatment with 
viloxazine.  
 
We begin viloxazine at 200 mg orally once daily in adults with ADHD. We increased by 200 mg weekly to 
a total daily dose of 600 mg daily. For individuals with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration 
rate <30 ml/min) we begin at 100  mg daily and titrate by 50 to 100 mg weekly to 200 mg total.  
 
Side effects include insomnia, fatigue, irritability, nausea, headache, elevation of blood pressure or heart 
rate, activation of mania or hypomania, and possible emergence of suicidal thoughts.  We monitor all 
adults treated with viloxazine for the emergence of suicidal thoughts or behaviors at each visit and are 
especially vigilant during the first few months of treatment and at times of dose changes.  
 
Clinical experience with viloxazine is limi ted. In an unpublished trial, 374 adults were randomly assigned 
to flexible dose of viloxazine (200 to 600 mg) or placebo for six weeks [69]. At treatment end, the 
reduction on the ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale, an 18 -point measure of symptoms, wa s 
greater in adults treated with viloxazine as compared with placebo (mean difference -3.7, 95% CI -6.2 to 
-1.2)."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|7|fdb74dc632ad4466b8f36911498a94bf
"Antidepressant medications — Bupropion, an atypical antidepressant, and nortriptyline, a TCA, have 
been shown to have efficacy in adults with  ADHD. We typically use them as a treatment option for 
adults with ADHD who have not responded to the above agents. However, we use bupropion in the 
treatment of individuals with co -occurring active major depression and ADHD as it has established 
efficacy for both disorders. (See 'Depression' below.)  
 
●Bupropion – While bupropion appears to be effective for adults with ADHD, clinical effects of 
bupropion may take up to several weeks to appear.  
 
We typically give sustained release bupropion beginning at 100 mg in the morning and, if tolerated, we 
increase to 100 mg twice daily after one to two weeks. We maintain at this dose for three to four weeks. 
If adequate response is not seen at that time (see 'Monitoring' below), we increase in 100 mg 
increments to a m aximum dose of 200 mg twice daily. We monitor at three to four weeks after each 
dose increase. Bupropion extended -release is given once daily beginning at 150 mg. We increase after 
several weeks depending on response to 300 mg per day and then 450 mg per d ay given once daily. We 
prefer to use the extended -release formulation, as it results in a smoother delivery and lower peak level 
making side effect of seizure less likely.

"A meta -analysis of five randomized trials with a total of 349 adult participants w ith ADHD found that 
bupropion led to a higher response rate (relative risk 1.67, 95% CI 1.23 -2.26) and a greater reduction in 
inattentive and overall ADHD symptoms compared with patients receiving placebo [72]. The rate of trial 
discontinuation (overall an d due to adverse drug effects) did not differ between groups. In another trial, 
162 adults with ADHD were randomly assigned to receive eight weeks of up to 450 mg/day of bupropion 
extended -release or placebo [73]. Individuals in the treatment group had a h igher rate of response 
(defined as 30 percent reduction in investigator -rated ADHD symptoms) than those in the placebo group 
(53 versus 31 percent). Bupropion was reported to be well tolerated with no serious or unexpected 
adverse effects and low rate of d iscontinuation (5 percent).  
 
There are no direct comparisons of stimulant and bupropion treatment in adult ADHD; comparison of 
effect sizes from placebo -controlled trials of the drugs suggests that stimulants lead to greater symptom 
reduction compared with  bupropion [74]. The efficacy of bupropion in the treatment of depression and 
for smoking cessation favors the use of the drug in adults with ADHD and one or both of these 
conditions.  
 
Side effects of bupropion include dry mouth, nausea, insomnia, dizzines s, anxiety, dyspepsia, sinusitis,"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|8|3e3fe2d34261414684da9b8c6f1359a2
"conditions.  
 
Side effects of bupropion include dry mouth, nausea, insomnia, dizzines s, anxiety, dyspepsia, sinusitis, 
and tremor. Bupropion may increase the risk of seizures, particularly with higher doses and shorter -
acting formulations and in patients with eating disorders [75]."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|8|71691b06a62c4de3b05551591594abaa
"●Tricyclic antidepressants – TCAs appear to be efficaciou s in adult ADHD [76]. In our clinical experience, 
however, TCAs are less effective than stimulants and more poorly tolerated than stimulants, and other 
non-stimulants . 
 
With the paucity of data regarding  TCAs for the treatment of adult ADHD, dosing is not well established. 
We typically start at a low dose and increase gradually. As an example, we begin nortriptyline at 10 mg 
daily and increase in 25 mg increments weekly until a therapeutic range is reache d (50 to 150 ng/ml). 
We check therapeutic levels and assure that the individual has a three - to four -week trial at each dose 
within the therapeutic range. If further increases are needed (eg, due to lack of response), we continue 
to increase the dose until  maximum therapeutic dose is reached (ie, 150 ng/ml), side effects limit further 
increases, or acceptable response is achieved (table 1).  
 
Benefits of TCAs treatment include their effectiveness in treating co -occurring depression or anxiety 
with ADHD, lack  of abuse liability, and single daily dosing. However, TCAs have greater side effects as 
compared with other medications that are effectively used in the treatment of ADHD. Additionally, TCAs 
may be lethal in overdose. Clinical trials comparing their effic acy have not been conducted.  
 
Due to potential cardiovascular effects (eg, hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, QTc prolongation)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|9|3abff712174c491295cb27c05770d600
"Due to potential cardiovascular effects (eg, hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, QTc prolongation) 
and cardiotoxicity of TCAs, we check ECG at baseline and at each dose increase as well as every four to 
six months during m aintenance treatment. Although plasma levels of TCAs do not appear to be related 
to efficacy, monitoring plasma levels at higher doses may help to avoid toxicity or overdose. Risks of 
cardiotoxicity, particularly with overdose, should prompt careful monito ring of TCA treatment. (See 
""Tricyclic and tetracyclic drugs: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects"".)  
 
INITIAL TREATMENT FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
 
Co-occurring disorders — We generally address comorbid disorders concurrently with attention defici t 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment. However, in some disorders, such as active substance use 
disorder (SUD), we often address the co -occurring disorder prior to treating ADHD. (See ""Attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: Epidemiology, c linical features, assessment, and diagnosis"", 
section on 'Comorbidity'.)  
Substance use and alcohol use disorder — Polysubstance use is common in adults with ADHD [77]. 
While there are few reports of severe health consequences due to acute co -administration  of alcohol 
and stimulants, some studies have documented that that administration of stimulants in conjunction 
with alcohol use results in potential risks beyond the additive respective behavioral effects of the"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|9|d73149e3f8c0480a9ad53462b9c59527
"with alcohol use results in potential risks beyond the additive respective behavioral effects of the 
substances [77]."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|9|827a7104e9184fbdaededf30993ecdc7
"Active substance use disor der — For individuals with active SUD, we treat the co -occurring SUD until 
stabilized prior to treating ADHD [77].  
 
However, clinical trials of stimulant treatment in ADHD patients with an active co -occurring SUD 
(nicotine, cocaine, and opioid dependence) have found mixed efficacy results [78 -82]. As an example, a 
clinical trial in 126 adults with both ADHD and cocaine use disorder randomly assigned patients to 
receive extended -release dextroamphetamine -amphetamine (60 or 80 mg/day) or placebo [78]. More 
patients achieved at least a 30 percent reduction in ADHD symptom severity in the 60 and 80 mg/day 
medication groups compared with placebo (75.0 and 58.1 versus 39.5 percent). The odds of a cocaine -
negative week were higher in the 80 and 60 mg/day groups (od ds ratios 5.46 and 2.92, respectively) 
compared with placebo.  
 
History of substance use disorder — To avoid the risks of misuse, addiction, or diversion of prescribed 
stimulants in adults with ADHD and a history of SUD, we suggest first -line treatment with  atomoxetine, a 
nonstimulant medication that inhibits presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake. Atomoxetine is effective for 
adult ADHD compared with placebo [65] and has been used safely in patients with co -occurring ADHD 
and an SUD [83,84]. Atomoxetine has li ttle to no abuse potential [61]. Viloxazine, a nonstimulant 
medication with similar properties is an acceptable alternative (algorithm 1). (See 'Alternatives to"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|10|1e455beaebfd45a2929fc5065e25920c
"medication with similar properties is an acceptable alternative (algorithm 1). (See 'Alternatives to 
stimulant medications' above.)  
 
Depression — We typically treat individuals with comorbid major  depressive disorder with bupropion, 
an antidepressant with established efficacy for both disorders [72]. Subsequent treatment of individuals 
with comorbid depression and ADHD who do not respond to bupropion may be found below and in the 
associated algorit hm (algorithm 2). (See 'For co -occurring disorders' below.)  
 
There are no clinical trials comparing the efficacy of medication treatments for co -occurring depression 
and ADHD in adults. Information on dosing bupropion is described in a table (table 1). Adm inistration, 
pharmacology and side effects of bupropion for depression can be found elsewhere. (See 
'Antidepressant medications' above and ""Atypical antidepressants: Pharmacology, administration, and 
side effects"", section on 'Bupropion'.)  
 
Anxiety disorde rs — We typically treat individuals presenting with ADHD with comorbid anxiety disorder 
(eg, generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety disorder) with the combination of a stimulant [5] and 
a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) 
[85]. We typically address the anxiety first by starting the SSRI or SNRI, and when the anxiety has 
improved we add a stimulant medication (algorithm 2). (See 'Choosing a stimulant' above.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|10|9b44f995762d4d83a9be7553cf792cfa
"The combination of a sero tonergic medication with a stimulant can lead to excessive serotonin activity. 
We monitor individuals treated with the combination of serotonergic reuptake inhibitor and stimulant 
for the presence of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life threatening syndr ome caused by excessive 
serotonin activity. Separate topics discuss stimulants, SSRIs, and SNRIs, as well as the serotonin 
syndrome. (See ""Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Management"", section on 'SRIs as preferred 
initial therapy' and ""Social anxie ty disorder in adults: Treatment overview"" and ""Serotonin syndrome 
(serotonin toxicity)"".)  
 
There are no clinical trials comparing efficacy among medication treatments for co -occurring anxiety 
disorders and ADHD in adults.  
Bipolar disorder — In individuals  with comorbid ADHD and bipolar disorder, we stabilize the mood 
symptoms (eg, mania, hypomania) and establish therapeutic levels of mood stabilizing medication prior 
to treatment for ADHD [86]. The risk of precipitation of manic symptoms in individuals tre ated with 
stimulant medications appears to be attenuated by having a stable bipolar status and being on mood 
stabilizing medications. In a retrospective analysis of data from the Sweden’s national health registries, 
adults with bipolar disorder initiating stimulant treatment while not on a mood stabilizing medication 
had an increased risk of treatment -emergent mania (hazard ratio 6.7, 95% CI 2.0 -22.4), while adults who"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|11|1e4e1d18740d45c399bcf7a1dcee4f81
"had an increased risk of treatment -emergent mania (hazard ratio 6.7, 95% CI 2.0 -22.4), while adults who 
were already receiving a mood stabilizing treatment did not (hazard ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 -0.9) [44].  
Pregnancy — When medications are used, we prefer to use amphetamine formulations in this 
population. Other options include a drug holiday (for those who can reasonably tolerate it) through at 
least the first trimester. For patients who have a h istory of doing well on methylphenidate and/or 
cannot tolerate an amphetamine, the clinician must weigh the risk to the mother and baby if the mother 
is not treated.  
Furthermore, the proportion of reproductive -aged, privately insured women in the United St ates who 
are treated with medication for ADHD has increased over the past two decades [88]. An analysis of data 
on approximately 4.6 million women per year, age 15 to 44 years, found that the proportion treated 
with an ADHD medication increased by 344 perc ent over a 12 -year period.  
 
MONITORING  EFFECTS OF MEDICATION  
We monitor for positive and negative effects of medications and adverse effects at each visit [89].  
Defining response — We work closely with the patient to establish what constitutes response (eg, 
reduction in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] symptoms and/or improved overall 
functioning) and the time course for improvement. While treatment  success may be defined as"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|11|0104ccc6471848438013d2de1d4965fd
"functioning) and the time course for improvement. While treatment  success may be defined as 
remission of all ADHD symptoms, improvement in the symptoms may be clinically significant and 
represent observable change from baseline [89] (see 'Monitoring' above and 'Monitoring for 
symptomatic improvement' below and 'Monitori ng for adverse effects' below). Improvement in overall 
functioning generally follows improvement of attention -related symptoms. Therefore, we suggest 
monitoring both through the use of repeat administration of rating scales and the assessment of overall 
functioning with regard to work and relationships. We also obtain permission to gather collateral"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|11|bbe08335c8af42f58195645a2127dfcc
"information from a reliable informant. Due to such issues as psychiatric comorbidity, clinicians and 
patients may not note immediate and/or sustained overall im provement in psychosocial functioning.  
 
Monitoring for symptomatic improvement — We use ADHD symptom checklists to monitor symptoms 
throughout treatment. We find it useful to get input from other informants that are familiar with the 
patient as well as inp ut from real -world collateral information such as job performance evaluation, 
attendance records, and grades. These may offer measures of progress tied to various performance 
venues that may be affected by ADHD treatment [90].  
 
Instruments for monitoring r esponse to treatment — We typically use the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating 
Scales [91] for diagnosis and determining symptom severity. We often supplement this with specific 
psychiatric rating scales for depression and anxiety. In addition, for patients with s evere executive 
dysfunction, we often use the Barkley Deficits in Executive Function Scale to identify targets for 
treatment and monitor over time (table 2). (See ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: 
Epidemiology, clinical features, assessm ent, and diagnosis"", section on 'Assessment' and ""Attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: Psychotherapy"", section on 'Monitoring'.)  
 
Other reliable scales include the Reliable Change Index [92], Barkley ADHD Rating Scale IV, and the"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|12|b7d9e216a68f42d2a867719fdb712f1f
"Other reliable scales include the Reliable Change Index [92], Barkley ADHD Rating Scale IV, and the 
Functional Impairment Scale for Adults [93 -95]. The Wender -Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder 
Scale [96,97] has subscales measuring temper, affective lability, and emotional overreactivity. The Weiss 
Functional Impairment Rating Scale [98] is useful for assess ing the domain and severity of functional 
impairment. Other domains that can be used for monitoring treatment response include quality of life, 
executive functions, and processing speed [99 -101].  
 
Monitoring for adverse effects — Once the individual is on the initial target dose of medication, we see 
them in monthly follow -up visits until symptoms are stabilized. At each visit, we check blood pressure 
and pulse and address any abnormalities accordingly. We monitor ECG and work directly with a 
cardiologist i n all individuals with baseline cardiac abnormalities. (See 'Pretreatment evaluation and 
contraindications' above and 'Adverse effects' above.)  
 
SUBSEQUENT TREATMENT  
 
For robust response — If a robust response is seen, the timing of stimulant use may still  require 
adjustment. The negative effects of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) differ across adults. 
We work with the individual to monitor improvement, and assist the patient in determining if 
medication needs adjustment for vocational, educ ational, or other activities. Some adults may benefit"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|12|1d5b940e76cf4ad5b1c78d50b829f478

from drug holidays on weekends or holidays. However, minimal data support this approach."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|12|a0d1a5c49cbf486d928156f80188dee0
"Although some adults may need stimulants for a time -limited period, others may need them 
indefinitely. (See 'Tre atment duration and continuity' below.)  
 
For suboptimal (partial or minimal) response — For individuals with a suboptimal response to initial 
treatment, we review the accuracy of the diagnosis, the presence of comorbid disease and adherence to 
medication. We address these as indicated. (See 'Co -occurring disorders' above.)  
 
Augmentation strategies for patients who experienced a suboptimal response to first -line medication 
treatment are limited. Our choice of subsequent management (eg, adjunctive psychothera py, 
pharmacologic management) depends, in part, on patient preference and availability of treatment.  
 
Adjunctive psychotherapy — For all individuals who were not started on combination treatment who 
are now agreeable to psychotherapy, we augment a suboptim al response to medication with cognitive -
behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting executive functioning. (See 'Preference for combination medication 
and CBT' above and ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: Psychotherapy"".)  
 
For noncomorbid ADHD — For adults with noncomorbid ADHD who continue to experience clinically 
significant symptoms despite initial treatment with amphetamines, (and who are unwilling to augment 
with psychotherapy, or if it is unavailable, or has been ineffective) we suggest chan ging medication to a"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|13|1e2181e4a59d45f898a87faa99dee508
"with psychotherapy, or if it is unavailable, or has been ineffective) we suggest chan ging medication to a 
methylphenidate product. No washout or tapering is necessary in switching from one stimulant 
preparation to another. Our transitioning dose in switching from one stimulant to another is based on 
whether the switch is due to lack of res ponse or side effects:  
 
●Lack of response – If the medication is being switched due to inadequate response without side 
effects, we suggest initiation of the new stimulant at a dose that is equivalent to or slightly lower than 
the dose of the current stimu lant.  
 
●Side effects – If the medication is being switched due to side effects or intolerance of the initial 
stimulant, we suggest retitration  of the new stimulant starting at the lowest or a much lower equivalent 
dose than the current stimulant.  
 
Equivalent initial stimulant doses, onset and duration of effect of stimulants used in adult ADHD are 
listed in the table (table 1)."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|13|aacbd203b2f34761a39b606196ce1226
"For patients who  do not experience an adequate response to (or are unable to tolerate) a therapeutic 
dose of either stimulant, we favor successive trials of other nonstimulant medications followed by trials 
of bupropion and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (see 'Alternati ves to stimulant medications' above). If 
none of these agents are sufficiently effective, we occasionally use an alpha -2 agonist such as clonidine 
or guanfacine, based on their efficacy in treating children with ADHD. (See 'Treatments with limited 
supporti ng data in adult ADHD' below.)  
 
For co -occurring disorders  
 
●Substance use and substance use disorder (SUD) – For adults with ADHD and a history of an SUD who 
cannot tolerate or do not respond to treatment with atomoxetine, we suggest treatment with 
buprop ion. Clinical trials have found bupropion to reduce overall symptoms of ADHD compared with 
placebo [72]. Additionally, bupropion has been used in the treatment of nicotine and cocaine 
dependence, decreasing the craving often associated with these disorders  [102 -104]. (See 'For 
noncomorbid ADHD' above.)  
 
In cases where atomoxetine and bupropion are not effective and there is not a history of stimulant 
abuse we consider a long -acting amphetamine with careful monitoring for signs of misuse, diversion, or 
addic tion. (See ""Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management"" 
and ""Continuing care for addiction"".)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|14|450bc0bf47314cf19cd385d9eb4c0103
"addic tion. (See ""Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management"" 
and ""Continuing care for addiction"".)  
 
●Depression – For adults with ADHD and depression whose ADHD symptoms do not respond to 
treatment with bupropion, we sugg est treatment with the combination of a long -acting stimulant for 
ADHD and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitor (SNRI) for depression. We are careful in prescribing the combination of an SSRI and a stimulant 
due to the possibility of serotonin syndrome. (See 'Anxiety disorders' above and ""Serotonin syndrome 
(serotonin toxicity)"".)  
 
If the combination of an SSRI or an SNRI and a stimulant is ineffective (or due to adverse effects) a TCA is 
a reasona ble alternative. Tricyclics have demonstrated efficacy in ADHD similar to their efficacy in 
depression [76] and similar to bupropion’s treatment of ADHD, but with more side effects (table 3). (See 
'For noncomorbid ADHD' above.)  
 
●Anxiety disorders – For ad ults with ADHD and co -occurring generalized anxiety disorder or social 
anxiety disorder whose ADHD symptoms do not respond to treatment with a long -acting stimulant 
combined with an SSRI or SNRI, we suggest treatment for both conditions with atomoxetine. 
Atomoxetine has been shown to have efficacy for both ADHD and anxiety, in the form of social anxiety"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|14|e8bafa2d109c4491b1db5f889ddc9b91

disorder, in adults [61,105 -107]. (See 'Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors' above.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|14|1c10297c131e4e01b80a1d14a33e4d04
"If atomoxetine is poorly tolerated or ineffective, we typically treat w ith a TCA, such as nortriptyline. 
Clinical trials have shown TCAs to be effective in both ADHD [76] and generalized anxiety disorder [85], 
although with somewhat greater side effects than other ADHD medication. TCAs have not been subject 
to clinical trials  in patients with co -occurring ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder. (See ""Generalized 
anxiety disorder in adults: Management"", section on 'Limited role of alternatives to SRIs as initial 
treatment'.)  
 
For adults with ADHD co -occurring with both depressio n and an anxiety disorder, who cannot tolerate or 
do not respond to treatment with the combination of a stimulant and an SSRI or SNRI, we suggest 
treatment with a TCA for ADHD and both comorbid disorders. (See 'Anxiety disorders' above.)  
 
Medication augmen tation strategies have been tested in the treatment of ADHD in children/adolescents 
(eg, stimulants plus guanfacine extended -release); however, augmentation in adults with ADHD is not 
supported by research data nor by our clinical experience. (See ""Pharmac ology of drugs used to treat 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents"".)  
 
Treatments with limited supporting data in adult ADHD  
 
●Alpha -2 adrenergic agonists – Little is known about the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of alph a-2-
adrenergic agonists clonidine and guanfacine in adults with ADHD. Small clinical trials have not shown"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|15|bffd84459f764e4d99709f966e538482
"adrenergic agonists clonidine and guanfacine in adults with ADHD. Small clinical trials have not shown 
these medications to reduce ADHD symptoms in adults compared with placebo [108,109]. The 
medications have been found to be efficacious in trials with  children and adolescents with ADHD, in 
particular for impulsivity and hyperactivity, for whom they are generally used third -line, or for certain 
clinical subgroups. (See ""Pharmacology of drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 
children and adolescents"", section on 'Alpha -2-adrenergic agonists'.)  
 
●Venlafaxine – Venlafaxine, a serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, may be 
mildly efficacious in reducing ADHD symptoms. A clinical trial of venlafaxine in 44 adults w ith ADHD did 
not find a statistically significant reduction in ADHD symptoms compared with placebo [110]. A greater 
proportion of patients receiving venlafaxine experienced a 25 percent or greater reduction in ADHD 
symptoms compared with patients on placeb o (75 versus 20 percent).  
 
●SSRI – While SSRI are often used along with stimulant medications in the treatment of comorbid ADHD 
with depression, there are few clinical trials of SSRI antidepressants in adults with ADHD. A randomized 
trial of 98 adults with ADHD and a lifetime diagno sis of an depression or anxiety disorder found no"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|15|5450ae50b4ef4e1a8caed73d30d91bf0

40 mg/day of paroxetine, 20 mg twice daily of dextroamphetamine, or placebo [111].  
 
●Solriamfetol – Solriamfetol, a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used 
for the treatment of sleepiness in individuals with narcolepsy may be effective in the treatment of adults 
with ADHD. In a trial, 60 adult subjects with ADHD were randomly a ssigned to six weeks of treatment 
with solriamfetol (75 or 150 mg/day) versus placebo [112]. At study endpoint, mean improvement as 
measured by the adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) was greater in those treated 
with medication as compare d with those that received placebo (mean difference AISRS -7.6 versus -2.1, 
respectively). Additionally, at six weeks, a greater percentage of individuals in the treatment group, as 
compared with those in the placebo group had Clinical Global Impression ra tings of much or very much 
improved (45 versus 6 percent) and met criteria for remission (24 versus 3 percent). Adverse effects 
were more common in the treatment group as compared with the placebo group for decreased 
appetite, headache, gastrointestinal di sturbance, insomnia, increased energy, and cardiovascular and 
neurologic effects. All reported adverse effects were either mild or moderate in severity. Further 
research confirming the efficacy and tolerability of solriamfetol is suggested."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|16|4fdf83774dea4691adfaf034b79c1046
"research confirming the efficacy and tolerability of solriamfetol is suggested.  
 
●Monoamine oxi dase inhibitor antidepressants (MAOIs) – Clinical trials of MAOIs have shown mixed 
results in adult ADHD. Patients with ADHD, a disorder characterized by impulsivity and inattention, may 
be poor candidates for treatment with these medications, which requir e dietary and other restrictions 
to avoid serious adverse events. (See ""Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Pharmacology, 
administration, safety, and side effects"".)  
 
●Neurostimulation – Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain  stimulation 
technique, may improve symptoms of inattention in adults with ADHD who are not taking stimulant or 
nonstimulant medications. In a randomized trial, 64 individuals with ADHD were treated with 28 
sessions (over four weeks) of daily home -based tD CS versus sham tDCS to the right dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex [113]. At the end of treatment, individuals receiving tDCS scored lower on measures of 
inattention (Adult ADHD Self -report scale [36 points, nine questions]) than those receiving sham tDCS 
(18.9 versus 23.6, respectively). However, effects on hyperactivity -impulsivity, depression, or anxiety 
symptoms were similar between groups. Further studies evaluating the effects of tDCS for adults with 
ADHD, including intensity, duration and number of sess ions are needed."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|16|b288bc3eddc74ec69c530999366fc7a3

●Other agents and complementary or alternative treatments – Trials of L -deprenyl [114], pargyline 
[115], modafinil [116], and cholinesterase inhibitors [117] have provided little evidence of efficacy of 
these agents in treating ADHD in ad ults.

products, including tetrahydrocannabinol (marijuana) have benefits for ADHD, few studies support the"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|16|743ea67f19fa42a3951c1c6e31558c42
"drug’s effectiveness for ADHD in adults. Additional ly, cannabis use appears to acutely impair cognitive 
functions such as attention, concentration, and episodic memory [118 -120]. These effects are time 
limited and dependent on dose, route of administration, and degree of tolerance.  
 
 
TREATMENT DURATION AND  CONTINUITY  
The negative effects of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) differ across adults. Some adults 
may need stimulants for a time -limited period, while others may need them indefinitely. In some cases, 
drug holidays on weekends or holida ys are useful. After providing information about the potential 
benefits and adverse events associated with stimulant treatment of ADHD, we advocate shared 
decision -making with the clinician reviewing potential therapeutic options and possibly making a 
reco mmendation. As with other clinical decisions described in this report and unless contraindicated, 
the adult patient has the final word in deciding which of the therapeutic options to follow.  
 
SUMMARY OF HOW TO TREAT ADHD IN ADULTS  
 
●Initial treatment for m ost – For most adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), we 
suggest initial treatment with a combination of medication management and cognitive -behavioral 
therapy (CBT) targeting executive dysfunction, rather than either treatment alone (Grade 2C) (algorithm 
2). (See 'Initial Treatment' above.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|17|9affdbf581dc465faf3958cde8583856
"therapy (CBT) targeting executive dysfunction, rather than either treatment alone (Grade 2C) (algorithm 
2). (See 'Initial Treatment' above.)  
 
•Amphetamines as initial pharmacologic treatment – For most adults with ADHD, we suggest initial 
pharmacologic management with an amphetamine rather than methylphenidate (Grade 2C) (table 1). 
(See  'Choosing a stimulant' above.)  
 
●Pharmacologic treatment for specific populations – Alternative medication and treatments may be the 
preferred initial therapy in some patients. (See 'Alternatives to stimulant medications' above and 'Initial 
treatment for specific populations' above.)  
 
•For co -occurring substance use or substance use disorder (SUD)  
 
-In individuals with an active SUD and comorbid ADHD, we stabilize the SUD prior to treating ADHD. (See 
'Active substance use disorder' above.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|17|ae1935ec911447de9e07a542fb09d1ee
"-For individuals with a history of SUD or substance misuse (eg, benzodiazepines, alcohol, opioids, 
stimulants), we suggest first -line choice of treatment with the nonstimulant atomoxetine (Grade 2C) 
(algorithm 1). (See 'History of substance use disorder' above. ) 
 
•Co-occurring depression – For adults with ADHD and co -occurring depression, we treat with bupropion. 
Bupropion has evidence of efficacy in both patients with ADHD and in patients with depression (Grade 
2C). (See 'Depression' above.)  
 
•Co-occurring anxi ety – For adults with ADHD and co -occurring generalized or social anxiety disorders, 
we treat the disorders at the same time with a combination of a stimulant and a selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). We typically start the SSRI first and the st imulant when the anxiety is lessened. 
(See 'Anxiety disorders' above.)  
 
•Pregnancy – For pregnant patients, we avoid methylphenidate when possible due to the risks to the 
fetus. We consider a drug holiday in pregnancy (for those who can reasonably tolerate  it) at least 
through the first trimester. When medications are used, we prefer to use amphetamines. (See 
'Pregnancy' above.)  
 
●Subsequent treatment  
 
•For robust response – If a robust response is seen, the timing of stimulant use may still require 
adjustm ent particularly for vocational activities and educational activities. (See 'For robust response' 
above.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|18|c03e40406b0049feac151e78c802d9c8
"adjustm ent particularly for vocational activities and educational activities. (See 'For robust response' 
above.)  
 
•Partial response – For individuals with a suboptimal response to initial treatment we review the 
accuracy of the diagnosis, the presence of comorbid  disease and adherence to medication. We address 
these as indicated. (See 'For suboptimal (partial or minimal) response' above.)  
 
-Adjunctive psychotherapy – For individuals initially treated with medication alone who have a 
suboptimal response, we suggest  augmentation with CBT targeting executive functioning (Grade 2C). 
Combination therapy with CBT and pharmacotherapy appears to be the most efficacious treatment for 
adults with ADHD. (See 'Adjunctive psychotherapy' above.)  
 
-Medication adjustment – For adu lts with noncomorbid ADHD who continue to experience clinically 
significant symptoms despite treatment with amphetamines (either in conjunction with cognitive"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|18|d5d100effef546c8b363ab17e72ed342
"processing therapy or when CBT is not available), we suggest changing treatment to a methylphenid ate 
product (Grade 2C). (See 'For noncomorbid ADHD' above.)  
 
For individuals with poor response or lack of tolerance to two prior stimulants, we favor successive trials 
of atomoxetine, bupropion, or a tricyclic antidepressant such as nortriptyline in addit ion to 
augmentation with CBT. Only limited data support these medications for treatment of ADHD in adults."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of Adults.pdf|19|5e7ee6d58e084aff81fde8cbcba59705

 Introduction 
Nearly two decades ago, an inter national team of scientists pub lished the first International 
Consensus Statement on attention‐ deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD) (Barkley, 2002). They 
sought to present the wealth of  scientific data attesting to th e validity of ADHD as a mental 
disorder and to correct misconce ptions about the disorder that  stigmatized affected people, 
reduced the credibility of health  care providers, and prevented  or delayed treatment of 
individuals challenged by the di sorder (DosReis et al., 2010; H orton‐Salway, 2013; McLeod et 
al., 2007; Mueller et al., 2012).  
This paper updates the Internation al Consensus Statement by cat aloging important scientific 
discoveries from the last 20 yea rs. We do not intend to present  an encyclopedia of ADHD or 
guidelines for diagnosis and trea tment. The latter can be found  in the references cited. Our aim 
is to provide current and accura te information about ADHD suppo rted by a substantial and 
rigorous body of evidence.   
Methods 
We identified evidence‐based statements about ADHD through expe rt scrutiny of published 
high quality meta‐analyses and ve ry large studies. Expert scrut iny was provided by a project

Apart from statements about the  history of ADHD and its diagnos tic criteria, we required each 
evidence‐based statement to be supported by meta‐analyses or by  large registry studies with 
more than 2,000 participants.  W e required meta‐analyses to rep ort data from five or more

standardized mean difference: sm all = 0.20, medium = 0.50, larg e = 0.80; correlation"|data_input/adhd_2/International Consensus Statement on ADHD.pdf|3|757276662e5b4ae5bc4edb8b782027bf

 coefficient: small = 0.10, mediu m = 0.24, large = 0.37 (Ellis,  2010; Rosenthal and Rosnow, 1984). 
“Moderate” is used as a synonym for “medium,” and “strong” for  “large.” A “small” effect is 
generally difficult to observe  in an individual but may be very  important for public health if it 
concerns a common exposure that  affects many children. A “mediu m” effect is expected to be 
noticeable to a careful observer  (Cohen, 1988). A “large” effec t is generally relevant to clinical 
practice at the level of the individual.  
If a topic is not included in this document, it does not mean t he topic is unimportant; rather, it 
means the evidence found was ins ufficient to allow firm conclus ions. This could be because 
there were insufficient studie s of quality, because no attempt  was made to assess publication 
bias, or because the data availa ble did not support the claims  made. After the document was 
completed, we invited addition al colleagues to join as signator ies to indicate their support of

 A Brief History: ADHD is not a New Disorder  
The concept of ADHD has a long history, starting with clinical  reports from European countries. 
The clinical significance of t he signs and symptoms of the diso rder has been recognized for over 
two centuries. Although these ea rly reports did not use the ter m “ADHD”, they described 
children who showed the symptoms  and impairments we now recogni ze as ADHD. For a 
detailed history see (Lange et  al., 2010; Taylor, 2011; Weikard , 1799). Here are highlights from 
the early history of ADHD:  
1. 1775: Melchior Adam Weikard, a German physician, wrote the firs t textbook description of 
a disorder with the hallmarks of ADHD. 
2. 1798: Alexander Crichton from the  Royal College of Physicians ( United Kingdom) described 
a similar disorder in a medical  textbook (Palmer and Finger, 20 01). 
3. 1845: Heinrich Hoffmann, who later  became head of the first psy chiatric hospital in 
Frankfurt am Main, Germany, desc ribed hyperactivity and attenti on deficits in a children’s 
book which documented ADHD‐like  behaviors and their associated  impairments (Hoffmann, 
1990). 
4. 1887‐1901: Désiré‐Magloire Bourn eville, Charles Boulanger, Geor ges Paul‐Boncour, and 
Jean Philippe described an equiva lent of ADHD in French medical  and educational writings 
(Martinez‐Badia and Martinez‐Raga, 2015). 
5. 1902: George Still, a physician in  the United Kingdom, wrote th e first description of the"|data_input/adhd_2/International Consensus Statement on ADHD.pdf|7|157a307c470546d4b8d8590343013182
"(Martinez‐Badia and Martinez‐Raga, 2015). 
5. 1902: George Still, a physician in  the United Kingdom, wrote th e first description of the 
disorder in a scientific journal (Still, 1902a; Still, 1902b, c )."|data_input/adhd_2/International Consensus Statement on ADHD.pdf|7|0990d577f7c240808ed2d240bf9cbb22

 6. 1907: Augusto Vidal Perera wrote  the first Spanish compendium o f child psychiatry. He 
described the impact of inattent ion and hyperactivity among sch oolchildren (Vidal Perera, 
1907).  
7. 1917: the Spanish neurologist and  psychiatrist Gonzalo Rodrigue z‐Lafora described 
symptoms of ADHD in children and  said they were probably caused  by a brain disorder with 
genetic origins (Lafora, 1917). 
8. 1932: Franz Kramer and Hans Polln ow, from Germany, described an  ADHD‐like syndrome 
and coined the term “hyperkineti c disorder”, which was later ad opted as a term by the 
World Health Organization (Kramer and Pollnow, 1932; Neumarker,  2005). 
9. 1937: Charles Bradley, from the U SA, discovered that an ampheta mine medication reduced 
ADHD‐like symptoms (Bradley, 1937). 
10. 1940s: ADHD‐like symptoms in child ren described as “minimal bra in dysfunction”. 
11. 1956‐1958: First hint in follow‐ up study of the persistence of  minimal brain dysfunction‐
related behaviors into adulthood  (Morris et al., 1956; O'Neal a nd Robins, 1958) 
12. 1960s: U.S. Food and Drug Adminis tration approved methylphenida te (Ritalin) for 
behavioral disorders in children. 
13. 1970s to today: Diagnostic criteri a for ADHD evolved based on r esearch showing that the

 How is ADHD diagnosed? 
ADHD can only be diagnosed by a  licensed clinician who intervie ws the parent or caregiver 
and/or patient to document crite ria for the disorder (American  Psychiatric Association, 2013; 
Chinese Society of Psychiatry,  2001; Faraone et al ., 2015; Feld man and Reiff, 2014; Pearl et al., 
2001; Stein, 2008; World Health Or ganization, 2018). It cannot  be diagnosed by rating scales 
alone, neuropsychological tests,  or methods for imaging the bra in. 
The diagnosis of ADHD has been c riticized as being subjective b ecause it is not based on a 
biological test. This criticism  is unfounded. ADHD meets standa rd criteria for validity of a mental 
disorder established by Robins a nd Guze (Faraone, 2005; 1970).  The disorder is considered valid 
because: 1) well‐trained profe ssionals in a variety of settings  and cultures agree on its presence 
or absence using well‐defined cr iteria and 2) the diagnosis is  useful for predicting a) additional 
problems the patient may have (e .g., difficulties learning in s chool); b) future patient outcomes 
(e.g., risk for future drug abus e); c) response to treatment (e .g., medications and psychological

 The main features of the diagnosis are: 
14. The diagnosis requires: 1) the pr esence of developmentally inap propriate levels of 
hyperactive‐impulsive and/or ina ttentive symptoms for at least  6 months; 2) symptoms 
occurring in different settings ( e.g., home and school); 3) sym ptoms that cause impairments 
in living; 4) some of the sympto ms and impairments first occurr ed in early to mid‐childhood; 
and 4) no other disorder better  explains the symptoms (American  Psychiatric Association, 
2013; World Health Organization , 2018; Yi and Jing, 2015).  
15. The clinical presentation of ADH D can be described as primarily  inattentive, primarily 
hyperactive‐impulsive, or combine d, depending on the nature of  their symptoms (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2013).  Meta‐analyses indicate that ina ttention is more strongly 
associated with academic impairm ent, low self‐esteem, negative  occupational outcomes 
and lower overall adaptive functi oning. Hyperactive‐impulsive s ymptoms are associated 
with peer rejection, aggression , risky driving behaviors and ac cidental injuries. Patterns of 
associated disorders also diffe r between the dimensions (Willcu tt et al., 2012). 
16. ADHD impairs the functioning of highly intelligent people, so t he disorder can be diagnosed 
in this group. A population‐base d birth cohort study of over 5, 700 children found no

 17. In adolescence and young adulthood , many individuals with a his tory of childhood ADHD 
continue to be impaired by the d isorder, although they often sh ow reduced hyperactivity 
and impulsivity while retaining sy mptoms of inattention (Faraon e et al., 2006). 
18. Many large epidemiologic and c linical studies show that ADHD of ten co‐occurs with other 
psychiatric disorders, especiall y depression, bipolar disorder,  autism spectrum disorders, 
anxiety disorders, oppositional  defiant disorder, conduct disor der, eating disorders, and 
substance use disorders (Berna rdi et al., 2012; Chen et al., 20 18c; Groenman et al., 2017; 
Nazar et al., 2016; Solberg et  al., 2018; Tung et al., 2016; Ya o et al., 2019). Their presence 
does not rule out a  diagnosis of ADHD.  
19. A meta‐analysis comprising 25 st udies with over eight million p articipants found that 
children and adolescents who are r elatively younger than their  classmates are more likely to

How Common is ADHD?

21. The latter meta‐analysis found no  increase in the prevalence of  ADHD in children and 
adolescents over the past three  decades (Polanczyk et al., 2014 ). Although the prevalence 
of ADHD has not changed in this time period, large studies from  the US and Sweden indicate 
that ADHD is more likely to have been diagnosed in recent years , which reflects changes in 
administrative and clinical pract ices (Rydell et al., 2018; Son g et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018). 
22. A meta‐analysis of six studies w ith over 5,300 participants est imated the prevalence of 
ADHD in adulthood to be 2.5% (Sim on et al., 2009). A meta‐analy sis of 20 studies 
encompassing 13 countries and seve n regions/metropolitan areas,  involving more than 
26,000 participants, estimated that 2.8% of adults meet criteri a for ADHD (Fayyad et al., 
2017). The lower prevalence in a dults compared with youth is co nsistent with a meta‐

What causes ADHD? 
For most people with ADHD, many  genetic and environmental risk  factors accumulate to cause 
the disorder (Faraone et al.,  2015). The environmental risks fo r ADHD exert their effects very 
early in life, during the feta l or early postnatal period.    I n rare cases, however, ADHD‐like 
symptoms can be caused by extreme deprivation early in life (Ke nnedy et al., 2016), a single 
genetic abnormality (Faraone and  Larsson, 2018), or traumatic b rain injury early in life 
(Stojanovski et al., 2019). Thes e findings are helpful to under stand the causes of ADHD but are"|data_input/adhd_2/International Consensus Statement on ADHD.pdf|13|bec85ec7a8644fe1975444da578a0afc
"(Stojanovski et al., 2019). Thes e findings are helpful to under stand the causes of ADHD but are 
not useful for diagnosing the di sorder. The associations betwee n aspects of the environment 
and the onset of ADHD have attain ed a very high level of eviden tial support. Some have strong 
evidence for a causal role but,  for most, the possibility remai ns that these associations are due"|data_input/adhd_2/International Consensus Statement on ADHD.pdf|13|7a312ea8b13a4d678bed7c00d8a55dc5

pre‐ and post‐natal environments t hat increase risk for ADHD as  correlates, rather than causes. 
The genetic and environmental ri sks described below are not nec essarily specific to ADHD. 
Genetic Causes of ADHD 
26. A review of 37 twin studies from the United States, Europe, Sca ndinavia, and Australia 
found that genes and their intera ction with the environment mus t play a substantial role in 
causing ADHD (Faraone and Larsso n, 2018; Larsson et al., 2014a;  Pettersson et al., 2019). 
27. In a genomewide study, an international team analyzed DNA from  over 20,000 people with 
ADHD and over 35,000 without ADHD from the United States, Europ e, Scandinavia, China, 
and Australia. They identified m any genetic risk variants, each  having a small effect on the 
risk for the disorder (Demonti s et al., 2019). This study confi rmed a polygenic cause for 
most cases of ADHD, meaning that many genetic variants, each ha ving a very small effect, 
combine to increase risk for the  disorder. The polygenic risk f or ADHD is associated with 
general psychopathology (Brike ll et al., 2020)  and several psy chiatric disorders (Lee PH, 
2019). 
28. Additional genes have been implicated by meta‐analyses, but the ir status as risk genes 
remains uncertain until validated  in a genomewide study. These  genes are  ANKK1 (Pan et"|data_input/adhd_2/International Consensus Statement on ADHD.pdf|14|be7985f4c28f4da9a4e32731677eabf6

 29. The polygenic risk for ADHD pred icts ADHD symptoms in the popul ation suggesting that the 
genetic causes of ADHD as a disor der, also influence lower leve ls of ADHD symptoms in the 
population (Demontis et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2019).  
30. In the population, those with a high polygenic risk for ADHD ar e more likely to have been 
diagnosed with ADHD (Li, 2019),  anxiety or depression (Martin e t al., 2018). 
31. ADHD can also be the result of r are single gene defects (Faraon e and Larsson, 2018) or 
abnormalities of the chromosome s (Cederlof et al., 2014). When  the DNA of 8,000+ children 
with autism spectrum disorder (A SD) and/or ADHD and 5,000 contr ols was analyzed, those 
with ASD and those with ADHD had an increased rate of rare gene tic mutations compared 
with controls (Satterstrom et al., 2019).  
32. Family, twin, and DNA studies show  that genetic and environment al influences are partially 
shared between ADHD and many oth er psychiatric disorders (e.g.  schizophrenia, 
depression, bipolar disorder, au tism spectrum disorder, conduct  disorder, eating disorders, 
and substance use disorders) a nd with somatic disorders (e.g. m igraine and obesity)

 What Have We Learned from Studyin g the Brains of People with AD HD?  
There are two broad classes of re search findings about the brai ns of people with ADHD. The 
first comes from studies of the  performance of patients on psyc hological tests that study 
mental processes. The  second comes from meth ods that directly e xamine brain structure or 
function with neuroimaging scans.  Although many of these studie s have found differences 
between groups of people who are  and are not diagnosed with ADH D, the differences are 
typically small and do not drama tically differ between people w ith ADHD and those with other 
disorders. They are, therefore,  not useful for diagnosing the d isorder (Thome et al., 2012). 
These differences are not caused  by drug treatment and, for som e patients, diminish or change 
as patients grow out of the disorder.

What is the Impact of ADHD  on Patients and Families? 
ADHD is a disorder associated with serious distress and/or impa irments in living. Although, as 
documented below, many severe a dverse outcomes have been associ ated with ADHD, the 
typical patient does not experience all, or even most, of these  problems. Many patients live 
enjoyable and productive lives, especially if they receive trea tment.

age‐, sex‐, and comorbidity‐matc hed controls drawn from Taiwan’ s National Health 
Insurance Research Database repo rted that having ADHD was assoc iated with a more than 
three‐quarters greater likelihood  of burn injury. For those und er six years old, the risk was 
doubled. For youths between six and seventeen years old, the in crease in risk was about 70 
percent. There were no significant differences between boys and  girls (Yeh et al., 2020).  
108. A meta‐analysis of 32 studies cov ering more than four million p eople found that those

Premature Death and Suicide 
114. A Danish study of almost two million people found ADHD is assoc iated with a small risk 
for premature death, mostly due t o accidents. When ADHD was acc ompanied by other

179. A meta‐analysis of twelve studie s with over 3,300 adults found  that those taking 
atomoxetine were about 40% more likely to discontinue treatment  due to adverse events 
than those on placebo (Cunill et  al., 2013). A meta‐analysis fo und that methylphenidate was 
more than twice as likely to i nduce insomnia as a tomoxetine (10  studies, over 3,000

boys not treated with methylpheni date with 118 treated boys, th e results did not indicate 
that methylphenidate increased t he probability of this adverse  outcome (McCarthy et al., 
2018). 
181. A study using Danish national reg isters followed over 700,000 i ndividuals for an average 
period of almost a decade. Looki ng at 8,300 people with ADHD, s timulant users had more 
than twice the rate of cardiovas cular events (primarily hyperte nsion) than nonusers. These 
events were rare (Dalsgaard et al., 2014). 
182. A meta‐analysis of five studies w ith over 43,000 children and a dolescents found no

a meta‐analysis of twelve studie s with over 3,300 adults found  40% greater rate of all‐cause

Misuse and Diversion of Stimulant Medications 
189. A systematic review of 109 studie s concluded that the non‐medic al use of prescribed 
stimulants is a significant public health problem, especially i n college students. Most non‐
medical use is associated with ze ro or minor medical effects, b ut adverse medical 
outcomes, including death, occur in some individuals, particula rly when administered by 
non‐oral routes. Academic and oc cupational performance enhancem ent were the most 
commonly cited motivations for n on‐medical use of stimulants, b ut there is little evidence 
that academic performance is imp roved by non‐medical use in ind ividuals without ADHD 
(Faraone et al., 2020).  
190. The non‐medical use of prescribed stimulants in individuals wit hout ADHD is associated 
with lower educational attainme nt. A U.S. prospective study fol lowed a nationally 
representative sample of over 8 ,300 high school seniors from ag e 18 to age 35. Those who 
used prescription stimulants non‐medically were 17% less likely  to earn a bachelor’s degree 
than those who had neither medic al or non‐medical use (McCabe e t al., 2017).

nonstimulants, but only one in 250 people with stimulant prescr iptions engaged in shopping 
behavior (Cepeda et al., 2014).  
192. A U.S. study of over 440,000 resp ondents found that use of ille gal drugs or other non‐
medical use of prescription drug s preceded non‐medical use of A DHD medication in more 
than three out of four cases (Sweeney et al., 2013). 
193. A study examined Swedish national  pharmacy dispensing data for  all 56,922 individuals 
who filled a methylphenidate pr escription between 2010 and 2011 . 4,304 of the 
methylphenidate users (7.6%) overused medication as measured by  dispensed 
prescriptions. Overuse was 17 ti mes more frequent for ages 46‐6 5 compared with ages 6‐12 
year. It was also twice as freque nt among those with previous a lcohol and drug misuse 
(Bjerkeli et al., 2018). 
194. Large studies of calls to U.S. p oison control centers related t o ADHD medications find 
that intentional exposures, including suspected suicide and med ication abuse and/or 
misuse is associated with admission to critical care units and,  rarely, death especially when 
snorted or injected (Faraone e t al., 2019a; King et al., 2018).

Behavioral and Cognitive‐Behavioral Therapies  
Behavioral treatments for ADHD ar e diverse in nature and have a  different content and focus 
depending on the age of the patient. For preschoolers and grade ‐school children, parents are 
trained to improve their method  of disciplining and interacting  with their children. For 
adolescents and adults, therapy  helps patients improve their or ganizational skills. For some 
patients, teachers contribute to  a program aimed at improving t he child’s behavior. Some of 
these therapies focus on improvin g social behaviors and develop ing practical skills. In this 
section, however, we focus only on the ability of such treatmen ts to improve ADHD symptoms. 
Readers should keep in mind that the failure of a treatment to  substantially improve ADHD 
symptoms does not mean it is not  useful for other purposes.

 ADHD is a chronic disorder in whi ch developmentally inappropria te symptoms of 
inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity  lead to impairments in many aspects of 
living. The disorder, which star ts in childhood or early adoles cence and is more common 
in boys than girls, affects 5.9% o f youth and 2.8% of adults wo rldwide. There are 
multiple genetic and environmenta l risk factors that accumulate  in various combinations 
to cause ADHD. These r isk factors lead to subtle changes in mul tiple brain networks and 
in the cognitive, motivational,  and emotional processes they co ntrol. People diagnosed 
with ADHD have an elevated risk  for school failure, antisocial  behavior, other psychiatric 
problems, somatic disorders, dru g and alcohol abuse, accidental  injuries, and premature 
death, including attempted and co mpleted suicide. As a result,  ADHD costs society 
hundreds of billions of dollars eac h year. Several medications  are safe and effective for 
treating ADHD and for preventing  many adverse outcomes. Non‐med ication treatments

 We have learned much about the c auses of ADHD but are only begi nning to understand how 
genes and environment combine to c ause the disorder and affect  the brain to produce 
symptoms and impairments.  Some  of these causes may be shared w ith ADHD's somatic 
comorbidities.  Examples include  oxidative stress, inflammation , and insulin resistance.   Future

"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Overview of treatment and 
prognosis  
INTRODUCTION  
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder that manifests in childhood with symptoms 
of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention. The symptoms affect cognitive, academic, behavioral, 
emotional, and social functioning [1].  
 
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA  
Diagnostic criteria for ADHD include symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention that 
occur in more than one setting and affect function (eg, academic, social, emotional, etc). The evaluation 
and diagnosis of ADHD is discussed separately. (See ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children 
and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"".)  
 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
 
Care coordination — ADHD is a chronic condition and should be managed in a manner similar to other 
chronic conditions of childhood [2,3]. In addition to regularly monitoring the effectiveness of 
therapeutic interventions, it is importan t for primary care clinicians to provide information to the 
caregivers and child about ADHD, help the caregivers set specific treatment goals, and offer information 
regarding local support groups if they are available (table 1) [2,4,5]. (See ""Children and youth with 
special health care needs"".)  
 
Regular communication between the caregivers and the teachers is important. This can occur through a 
daily report card or a weekly communication book."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|0|34dd81de776541e392a077f1c254d061
"daily report card or a weekly communication book.  
 
Involvement of patient and caregivers — Treatment of ADHD may i nvolve behavioral interventions, 
medication, school -based interventions, or psychological interventions alone or in combination. 
Decisions regarding the choice of therapy should involve the patient (if at least school -aged) and their 
caregivers. Together w ith the treating clinician, the patient and caregivers must evaluate the risks and 
benefits of the various treatment options to determine the optimal treatment strategy [2,3]. (See 
'Treatment modalities' below.)  
 
Target goals — The management of children w ith ADHD centers upon the achievement of target 
outcomes that are realistic, achievable, and measurable [6]. Specific target outcomes may change over 
the course of treatment and should be determined in collaboration with the caregivers, child, and school"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|0|f331a580d0384b8d97eb9605248e6aba
"personnel. Between three and six target outcomes can be addressed at any given time. Progress can be 
monitored with a daily report card.  
 
Examples of target outcomes include [7]:  
 
●Improved relationships with caregivers, teachers, siblings, or peers (eg, pl ays without fighting at 
recess)  
 
●Improved academic performance (eg, completes academic assignments)  
 
●Improved rule following (eg, does not talk back to the teacher)  
 
Treatment of coexisting conditions — As many as one -third of children with ADHD have one  or more 
coexisting condition (eg, learning disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety 
disorder, mood disorders, tics, sleep disorders) [8,9]. It is important to treat coexisting conditions 
concurrently with ADHD; treatment of coex isting conditions may influence the treatment for ADHD [3]. 
Adjunctive behavioral, psychological, and pharmacologic interventions may be necessary for managing 
the full spectrum of symptoms in children with ADHD and coexisting conditions [10].  
 
Treatment o f sleep problems may improve ADHD symptoms. In a randomized trial, families of 244 
children (5 to 12 years of age) with ADHD and parent -reported moderate to severe sleep problems who 
met diagnostic criteria for at least one sleep disorder (eg, delayed slee p phase, sleep onset disorder) 
were assigned to receive a brief behavioral sleep intervention or usual care; 88 percent of children in"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|1|8a679e654f604db2a0676482b037f6c1
"were assigned to receive a brief behavioral sleep intervention or usual care; 88 percent of children in 
both groups were receiving pharmacotherapy (predominantly methylphenidate) [11]. The intervention 
consisted of two consul tations about sleep with a trained clinician two weeks apart and a follow -up 
phone call two weeks later. At the three - and six -month follow -up, children in the intervention group 
had greater, albeit modest, improvements in ADHD symptoms and teacher -reporte d behavior than 
control children. (See ""Cognitive and behavioral consequences of sleep disorders in children"", section on 
'Clinical consequences of sleep deficiency'.)  
 
Indications for referral — ADHD in children 4 to 18 years of age without comorbid conditions can usually 
be managed by the primary care provider [3]. Indications for referral to or consultation with a specialist 
(eg, developmental behavioral pediatrician, child neurologist, psychopharmacologist, child psychiatrist, 
clinical chi ld psychologist) may include [3,4,12]:"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|1|dffe73a8c2cd4589ac4829690c68bdc8
"●Coexisting psychiatric conditions (eg, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, substance abuse, 
emotional problems) (see ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical 
featu res and diagnosis"", section on 'Evaluation for coexisting disorders')  
 
●Coexisting neurodevelopmental, neurologic, or medical conditions (eg, seizures, tics, autism spectrum 
disorder, learning disorders, intellectual disabilities, sleep disorder) (see ""Att ention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"", section on 'Differential diagnosis')  
 
●Lack of response to a controlled trial of stimulant therapy or atomoxetine (see ""Attention deficit 
hyperactivity dis order in children and adolescents: Treatment with medications"", section on 'Dose 
titration')  
 
●Complex psychosocial circumstances (eg, trauma or other adverse childhood experiences)  
 
OVERVIEW OF MANAGEMENT  
The recommended treatment strategies for children with ADHD vary according to age [3,13]. The 
American Academy of Pediatrics [3], American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry [2], the 
United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [14], the Scottish Intercollegiate 
Guideline Net work [13], and the European Network for Hyperkinetic Disorders [15] have developed 
guidelines or practice parameters for the evaluation and management of children with ADHD. The"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|2|251d7d231e2e4c0c936518a5d00582e3
"guidelines or practice parameters for the evaluation and management of children with ADHD. The 
Society for Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics have guidelines and proces s of care algorithms for 
evaluation and management of children with complex ADHD [10,12]. The recommendations included in 
this topic review are consistent with the recommendations of these groups. (See 'Society guideline links' 
below.)  
 
Preschool children — For preschool children (age 4 through 5 years) who meet the diagnostic criteria for 
ADHD, we recommend parent (caregiver) training in behavior management (PTBM; also known as 
behavior therapy) rather than medication as the initial therapy [3,13,16]. Beha vior therapy can be 
administered by the caregivers or teachers following consultation with a behavioral therapist. (See 
""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"", 
section on 'Diagnosis' and 'Psy chosocial interventions' below.)  
 
The addition of medication to behavior therapy may be indicated if target behaviors do not improve 
with behavioral therapy alone and the child's function continues to be impaired. Examples of situations 
in which it may be warranted to add medication to behavioral therapy for preschool children include 
[10,17]:"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|2|abdea22740f94eb5a6254fcac695100e
"●Expulsion (or threatened expulsion) from preschool or daycare  
 
●Significant risk of injury to self, other children, or caregivers  
 
●Strong family history of ADHD  
 
●Suspected or established central nervous system injury (eg, prenatal alcohol or cocaine exposure)  
 
●ADHD symptoms interfere with other needed therapies  
 
When medication is necessary for preschool children, we suggest methylphenidate rather than 
amphetamine s or nonstimulant medications [2,3,18]. (See ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 
children and adolescents: Treatment with medications"", section on 'Preschool children'.)  
 
Some children diagnosed with ADHD during the preschool or early school years may no longer meet 
criteria for ADHD after school entry or in the later school years [19]. New diagnoses for such children 
may include autism spectrum disorder, learning disorders , and anxiety, highlighting the importance of 
monitoring young children diagnosed with ADHD for other neurodevelopmental and behavioral 
disorders over time. Comprehensive reevaluation during the school years may be warranted. (See 
'Prognosis' below.)  
 
Scho ol-age children — For most school -aged children and adolescents (≥6 years of age) who meet the 
diagnostic criteria for ADHD and specific criteria for medication, we suggest initial treatment with 
stimulant medication combined with PTBM (behavior therapy) t o improve core symptoms and target"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|3|80a85f62e5894cd58ea9ef8465aae84c
"stimulant medication combined with PTBM (behavior therapy) t o improve core symptoms and target 
outcomes [2,3,13,15,16,20,21]. However, nonstimulant medications may be more appropriate for 
certain children. Comorbid conditions must be considered in selecting a specific treatment approach 
[10].  
 
The values and prefer ences of the patient and caregivers are critical factors in deciding whether to 
initiate medication [3]. The decision of caregivers who choose to decline medication must be respected. 
(See ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescen ts: Treatment with medications"", 
section on 'Choice of agent' and 'Psychosocial interventions' below.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|3|f754d2be25f54b729510953cb5d93488
"Children who do not meet ADHD criteria — We recommend behavioral interventions for children with 
problematic behavior who do not meet the diagnostic cri teria for ADHD. (See 'Psychosocial 
interventions' below.)  
 
Monitoring — ADHD is a chronic disease [3]. Children undergoing treatment for ADHD should be 
monitored regularly for adherence to the treatment plan, adverse effects of therapy (for those on 
medica tions), and response to therapy (eg, the achievement of target goals and the occurrence of core 
symptoms) [2 -4,22]. If the selected management strategy does not result in attainment of the target 
outcome, the original diagnosis, comorbid conditions, and ad herence to management plan should be 
reevaluated [2]. (See ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical 
features and diagnosis"", section on 'Evaluation'.)  
 
Adverse effects of medications and monitoring for adverse effects  of medications are discussed 
separately. (See ""Pharmacology of drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children 
and adolescents"" and ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment 
with medications"" , section on 'Managing stimulant adverse effects'.)  
 
The frequency of follow -up visits depends upon whether the child is receiving medication and how well 
the core symptoms and target behaviors are being controlled. Children who are not receiving"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|4|610edbe98dc04bf3acb42261c53688dd
"the core symptoms and target behaviors are being controlled. Children who are not receiving 
medicatio n should be seen at least twice per year, particularly during critical transitions (eg, into middle 
school or high school). The monitoring schedule for children receiving medication depends upon the 
stage of pharmacotherapy [6]. It may range from weekly du ring the titration stage to every three or six 
months during the maintenance phase, depending upon adherence, coexisting conditions, and the 
persistence of symptoms. (See ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: 
Treatment with  medications"", section on 'Dose titration'.)  
 
Response to treatment — Response to treatment is demonstrated by objective measurement of 
reduction in core symptoms and/or improvement in target goals (eg, 40 to 50 percent reduction in core 
symptoms compared with baseline; decreased proportion of missing assignments from 60 to 20 percent 
per week) [6]. Core symptoms can be monitored through the use of ADHD -specific rating scales (table 
2); target symptoms can be monitored through a daily report card or periodi c narrative reports from the 
child's teacher [6,23]. Caregiver reports correlate poorly with teacher reports and cannot be used as a 
proxy for teacher reports [24,25]. A toolkit that provides information about daily report cards is 
available through the Na tional Institute for Children's Health Quality."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|4|50323a698c74475eafc71a553c452e8f
"available through the Na tional Institute for Children's Health Quality.  
 
Inadequate or lack of response to treatment may be due to [2,6]:"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|4|13bb43cf2274443c8c32780de92ecd7d
"●Coexisting conditions (eg, language or learning disorders, mental health disorder, psychosocial 
stressor) (see ""Attention deficit hyperactiv ity disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features and 
diagnosis"", section on 'Evaluation for coexisting disorders')  
 
●Nonadherence to the treatment plan  
 
●Incorrect or incomplete diagnosis (see ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in childre n and 
adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"", section on 'Differential diagnosis')  
 
For children with inadequate or lack of response to treatment, repetition of the diagnostic evaluation 
may be warranted, with increased focus on coexisting condition s that are associated with ADHD or 
mimic its symptoms (eg, sleep disorders, epilepsy, learning disorders, etc). The nonspecific improvement 
in behavior that occurs with stimulant medication can mask other problems and/or delay the use of 
more appropriate i nterventions (eg, serotonin reuptake inhibitor for depression) [22,26]. (See 
""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"", 
section on 'Evaluation'.)  
 
TREATMENT MODALITIES  
 
Psychosocial intervention s — Psychosocial interventions include modifications in the physical and social 
environment that are designed to change behavior using rewards and nonpunitive consequences [3,27]. 
Behavioral management techniques that are used for children with ADHD includ e positive"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|5|71e828b104844058a0aa2670bd02e053
"Behavioral management techniques that are used for children with ADHD includ e positive 
reinforcement, time -out, response cost (withdrawing rewards or privileges when unwanted or problem 
behavior occurs), and token economy (a combination of positive reinforcement and response cost) [28].  
 
Psychosocial interventions, particularly behavioral ones, are preferred to medication as the initial 
intervention for preschool children with ADHD and are adjuncts to medication for school -aged children 
and adolescents [3,14,29 -31]. Behavioral intervention s also can be used for children who have problems 
with inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity but do not meet criteria for ADHD [3]. (See ""Attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment with medications"", section on 
'Prerequisites' and 'School -age children' above.)  
 
Parent (or caregiver) training in behavior management (PTBM) is aimed at improving parent -child 
relationships through enhanced parenting techniques [17]. Behavioral interventions are most effective if 
caregiv ers understand the principles of behavior therapy (ie, identification of antecedents and altering 
the consequences of behavior) and the techniques are consistently implemented [17,28]. PTBM 
therapists or programs (typically eight or more sessions) are avai lable in many communities [6,32]."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|5|4c88f36561834df495750feef4036537
"Clinicians can request references for a suitable behavioral therapist from professional organizations (eg, 
Association for Behavior and Cognitive Therapies) or ADHD advocacy organizations (eg, Children and 
Adults with Atte ntion Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) provides additional resources for parents seeking PTBM [32].  
 
Behavioral interventions and environmental changes that can be used by caregivers or teachers to shape  
the behavior of children with ADHD include [33]:  
 
●Maintaining a daily schedule  
 
●Keeping environmental distractions to a minimum  
 
●Providing specific and logical places for the child to keep their schoolwork, toys, and clothes  
 
●Setting small, reachable goals (see 'Target goals' above)  
 
●Rewarding positive behavior (eg, with a ""token economy"")  
 
●Identifying unintentional reinforcement of negative behaviors  
 
●Using charts and checklists to help the child stay ""on task""  
 
●Limiting choices  
 
●Finding activiti es in which the child can be successful (eg, hobbies, sports)  
 
●Using calm discipline (eg, time out, distraction, removing the child from the situation)  
 
Additional tips for caregivers of children age 6 to 12 years are available through the National Instit ute 
for Children's Health Quality toolkit, free with registration, and the CDC. (See 'Resources' below.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|6|7e577417797443098ea1a2f0a9212ede
"Standardized training programs for caregivers of preschool children with disruptive behavior disorders 
(including symptoms of ADHD) that have been evaluated in systematic reviews include [27,34,35]:  
 
●Incredible Years Parenting Program (www.incredibleyears.com/index.asp)  
 
●New Forest Parenting Program (specifically designed to address ADHD symptoms)  
 
●Positive Parenting Program (Triple P)  
 
●Parent -Child Interaction Therapy  
 
●Helping the Noncompliant Child  
 
Adolescents may also benefit from direct skills training [3], which is intended to build the adolescent's 
skills to meet age -appropriate expectations and functional demands. Direct skills training m ay include 
homework organization, time management, study skills, and self -monitoring skills. A systematic review 
of psychosocial treatment programs for adolescents found small - to medium -sized improvements in 
parent -rated ADHD symptoms, co -occurring behavi oral and emotional symptoms, and interpersonal 
functioning, but more robust improvements in academic and organizational skills [21].  
 
Evidence supporting behavioral interventions for ADHD is limited. In an individual participant data meta -
analysis that inc luded 2233 children and adolescents with ADHD, behavioral interventions (eg, PTBM, 
classroom interventions, skills training) had small to moderate effects on individual and collective 
symptoms of ADHD and global impairment in unblinded assessments by paren ts or teachers [36]. In a"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|7|1e16b209b8a9496cadac359a57b2d5f7

(eg, improved competence or mental health, decreased negative parenting [eg, corporal punishment, 
harsh discipline]) compared wit h control [37]. Techniques focused on changing antecedent behavior and 
reinforcement appeared to be most effective.  
 
Studies of behavior therapy in other populations of children provide indirect evidence of benefit. In a 
meta -analysis of eight studies in p reschool children with disruptive behavior disorders (including 
children at risk for ADHD), PTBM was associated with improved parent -reported child behavior 
(standardized mean difference -0.68, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.47) [27]. The standardized mean difference (also 
called the effect size) describes the extent to which the performance in the treatment group differed"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|7|fc9cc88c8ca540d292d8aa0148941cf7
"from that in the control group; by consensus, differences of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 are considered small, 
moderate, and large, respectively. The addition  of school or daycare interventions to parent -child 
behavior therapy appeared to have some benefit for children from families of lower socioeconomic 
status. The long -term effects of behavior therapy for ADHD have not been determined [18].  
 
In most systemat ic reviews, behavioral interventions alone do not appear to reduce the core symptoms 
of ADHD in school -aged children but may improve other problem behaviors (eg, aggression, caregiver -
child relations) [38 -42]. However, two systematic reviews found behavior al interventions to be effective 
[43,44]. The conclusions of the systematic reviews are limited by the quality of the included studies 
[39,40,45,46]. Problems include insufficient description of the intervention and the complexity of the 
child's family, sc hool, social, and peer environments [31].  
 
Pharmacotherapy — We suggest medications with or without behavioral/psychological interventions for 
most school -aged children (≥6 years) and adolescents who meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD (table 3) 
[2,3,13]. (S ee ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features and 
diagnosis"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)  
 
We also suggest medications as an adjunct to behavioral interventions for preschool children (age 4"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|8|10d3e7c1888040f5b86e0aff826b8574
"diagnosis"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)  
 
We also suggest medications as an adjunct to behavioral interventions for preschool children (age 4 
through 5 years) who m eet diagnostic criteria for ADHD and fail to respond adequately to behavioral 
interventions alone. However, the values and preferences of the patient and caregivers are critical 
factors in deciding whether to initiate medication [3]. The decision of caregi vers who choose to decline 
medication must be respected (see 'Overview of management' above). Comorbid conditions must be 
taken into account when selecting a specific treatment approach and when evaluating its effectiveness.  
 
In addition to reducing core A DHD symptoms, pharmacotherapy may be associated with reduced risk of 
mortality, particularly from unnatural causes. (See 'Prognosis' below.)  
 
Treatment of ADHD with medications, including the choice of agent and dose titration, is discussed 
separately. (Se e ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment with 
medications"".)  
 
Combination therapy — Combination therapy uses both psychosocial interventions and medications. 
Combination therapy may be warranted in preschool childr en who do not respond to behavioral 
interventions alone [2]. In a systematic review and a meta -analysis, combination therapy with 
medications and behavior/psychological therapy was superior to behavior/psychological therapy alone 
[39,47]. (See 'Preschool c hildren' above.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|8|2b71573cb88a4355a2c621bbda9a38d5
"Combination therapy may be beneficial for school -aged children and adolescents who have a suboptimal 
response to pharmacotherapy, have a coexisting condition, or experience stressors in family life [2]. In 
systematic reviews of randomized trials (including the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with 
ADHD), combined medication and behavior treatment was no more effective than medication treatment 
alone in improving core symptoms of ADHD [39,47,48]. However, children receiving combined 
treatment may require lower doses of medication and achieve greater improvement in non -ADHD 
symptoms (eg, oppositional/aggressive, internalizing, teacher -rated social skills, caregiver -child 
relations, and reading achievement) than children receiv ing medication alone [21,30,48]. (See 'School -
age children' above.)  
 
School -based interventions — School -based interventions may include the provision of tutoring or 
resource room support (either in an exclusive setting or within the classroom [ie, inclusi on classes]), 
classroom modifications, accommodations, behavioral interventions, or direct skills training 
[3,21,33,49].  
 
Classroom modifications and accommodations may include having assignments written on the board, 
sitting near the teacher, having exten ded time to complete tasks, being allowed to take tests in a less 
distracting environment, or receiving a private signal from the teacher when the child is ""off -task."" The"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|9|9208266303ff450bb5e4a37f564b4355
"distracting environment, or receiving a private signal from the teacher when the child is ""off -task."" The 
teacher's completion of a daily report card facilitates the monitoring of symptoms a nd the need for 
changes in the treatment plan. (See 'Response to treatment' above.)  
 
The school also may provide behavior management programs that target ADHD symptoms and/or 
enhanced academic and social function [3]. Information for teachers of children w ith ADHD is available 
through Children and Adults with Attention -Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.  
 
Evidence supporting school -based interventions is limited [50,51]. A systematic review [50] found two 
cohort studies (and one extension) that demonstrated tha t classroom -based programs to enhance 
academic skills were effective in improving achievement scores in multiple domains, but the benefits 
were sustained only as long as the intervention is continued [52 -54]. 
 
In the United States, ADHD is considered to be  a disability under the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act (IDEA [PL -101-476]). Under IDEA, children with ADHD may qualify for special education or 
related services. Alternatively, they may qualify for appropriate accommodations within the regular  
classroom setting under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (table 4) [49]. In addition, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act may provide individuals with ADHD reasonable accommodations in"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|9|7d721f7a0a114cd28b8751e423bd22aa
"Americans with Disabilities Act may provide individuals with ADHD reasonable accommodations in 
secular private schools and post -secondary education (tab le 5). The completion of a daily report card or 
a ""communication book"" to facilitate communication between the caregivers and the teachers may be 
suggested as an accommodation under a 504 plan. (See ""Definitions of specific learning disorder and 
laws perta ining to learning disorders in the United States"", section on 'Laws affecting the education of"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|9|e20806a0484448eab21b36da9c7b3c49
"students with disabilities' and ""Children and youth with special health care needs"", section on 'School -
based services'.)  
 
Social skills training — Deficits in s ocial skills and problems with peers require direct targeting over the 
long -term [55]. Social skills deficits can be addressed through social skills groups or similar interventions 
(in or out of the school setting).  
 
Psychotherapy interventions — Psychothe rapy interventions are distinct from behavioral interventions. 
Psychotherapy interventions are directed toward the child (rather than the caregiver or environment) 
and designed to change the child's emotional status (eg, play therapy) or thought patterns ( eg, 
cognitive -behavior therapy, cognitive therapy).  
 
We generally suggest against psychotherapy interventions for children with ADHD unless they have 
coexisting conditions that require psychotherapy interventions (eg, depression, anxiety, social deficits).  
In randomized trials and systematic reviews, psychotherapy interventions have not been proven 
beneficial for the core symptoms of ADHD in children [18,42,56]. Gains achieved with psychotherapy 
interventions in the treatment setting usually do not transfer  to other settings (eg, classroom or home).  
 
However, psychotherapy interventions may be helpful in addressing coexisting conditions or skill 
deficits. Play -based interventions may improve social skills in children with ADHD [57,58]. Cognitive -"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|10|6f4443a1740a4dcabd8e316c50667209
"deficits. Play -based interventions may improve social skills in children with ADHD [57,58]. Cognitive -
behavioral t herapy (CBT) may improve organizational/planning skills, cognitive function, and/or 
coexisting psychiatric problems in adolescents with ADHD and may be a helpful adjunct to medications 
[59-64]. 
 
UNPROVEN INTERVENTIONS  
 
Physical activity — At least 60 minut es of moderate to vigorous activity per day is recommended for all 
children ≥6 years of age, not just those with ADHD [65]. Regular physical activity has been associated 
with improved cardiovascular health, psychosocial well -being, and cognitive performanc e. (See ""Physical 
activity and strength training in children and adolescents: An overview"", section on 'Physical activity'.)  
 
We support this recommendation for children with ADHD. In systematic reviews and small open -label 
controlled trials with heterogen eous designs, a range of physical activities (eg, yoga, team sports, 
aerobic activity, guided walks) have been associated with improvement in the core symptoms of ADHD 
with little risk of harm [66 -76]. Small trials also suggest that aerobic exercise improv es neurocognitive 
function [66] and increases the effectiveness of stimulant medications [77]. In meta -analyses, physical 
activity was associated with improved cognitive function and psychological well -being [64,76]. In one of"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|10|16f2f9c29844451aa0fb64c0f26a86f9
"the analyses, cognitive funct ion improved with a mean effect size of 0.93 (95% CI 0.48 -1.45) [64]. 
Additional studies are needed to determine which types, duration, intensity, and frequency of exercise 
are most effective.  
 
Dietary interventions  
 
Elimination diets — We generally do not suggest elimination diets for children with ADHD, but decisions 
regarding trials of dietary interventions for ADHD must be made on a case -by-case basis. Some experts 
suggest that a short (no more than five -week) tria l of an elimination diet may be warranted for certain 
children (eg, those whose caregivers are concerned about the use of and potential side effects of 
pharmacologic agents and are motivated to adhere to the diet) [78 -80]. If the decision is made to try an  
elimination diet, the diet should be supervised by the child's health care provider and a dietician to 
ensure adequate nutritional intake. If behavior improves during the elimination diet, restricted foods 
can be added back weekly, one component at a time , to identify problematic foods that should be 
excluded from a less restrictive permanent diet.  
Clinical guidelines and practice parameters from the American Academy of Pediatrics [3], the American 
Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology [88], and the Unit ed Kingdom's National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) [14] do not routinely recommend elimination diets for the treatment of"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|11|ddc648596750480b9812b9088e5eeb49
"and Care Excellence (NICE) [14] do not routinely recommend elimination diets for the treatment of 
ADHD. However, the NICE guidelines indicate that referral to a dietician may be warranted if perceived 
links betwee n specific foods or beverages and behavior are corroborated with a food diary [14].  
 
Essential fatty acid supplementation — We do not suggest essential fatty acid supplementation to 
improve core symptoms in children with ADHD. Some studies have noted decre ased fatty acid 
concentrations in the serum of children with ADHD [89 -93]. However, evidence that fatty acid 
supplementation improves core symptoms in children with ADHD is limited [86,94 -98]. Meta -analyses of 
randomized trials have conflicting results [18 ,42,94,96,98], and clear evidence of benefit is lacking [99]. 
Fatty acid supplementation is unlikely to be harmful.  
 
Trigeminal nerve stimulation — We do not suggest trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) for the treatment 
of ADHD in children. Clinical experie nce is limited [107,108].  
 
TNS is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique based on the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of 
the trigeminal nerve (supraorbital branch) affects the areas of the brain thought to be involved in ADHD 
[109,110].  
 
Although a  randomized trial found that TNS improved scores on ADHD -IV Rating Scales and Clinical 
Global Impression scales over four weeks, only 62 children were included [107]. No clinically important"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|11|e8048b1e9fc847b5ab252c20d3a02a85
"adverse effects were reported. Additional studies are necessary t o confirm efficacy and safety, and to 
determine which of children with ADHD are most likely to benefit as well as the optimal regimen [110].  
 
Other alternative therapies — Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies may be 
considered or employed  by as many as 64 percent of patients with ADHD [111]. CAM therapies often are 
used by patients without the explicit knowledge of the primary care provider [112 -114]. It is important 
for primary care providers to ask their patients whether they have tried any CAM therapies for ADHD so 
that the risks and benefits of such therapies can be discussed [115].  
 
CAM therapies other than physical activity, elimination diets, fatty acid supplementation, and 
mindfulness that have been suggested in the management of AD HD include vision training, 
megavitamins, herbal and mineral supplements (eg, St. John's wort), neurofeedback/biofeedback, 
chelation, and applied kinesiology, among others. Most of these interventions have not been proven 
efficacious in high -quality random ized controlled trials [42,64,116 -128]. We do not routinely suggest 
these interventions for children with ADHD. (See ""Clinical use of St. John's wort"", section on 'Other 
conditions'.)  
 
Several alternative therapies, including chelation and megavitamins, ma y have serious adverse effects or"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|12|9ddeced2cd214d98b40e6512eb14e81c
"conditions'.)  
 
Several alternative therapies, including chelation and megavitamins, ma y have serious adverse effects or 
harmful interactions with other herbs, vitamins, supplements, and prescribed medications [3,129 -131]. 
Additional harms include the potential failure and setback for the child when symptoms and problems 
persist, as well as unnecessary expenses, time cost, and opportunity cost when evidence -based ADHD 
treatments are delayed [116].  
 
Clinicians can help caregivers who choose to explore CAM therapies to make thoughtful choices by 
[6,132]:  
 
●Reviewing the stated goals or effects for a given treatment  
 
●Reviewing the evidence of benefits and potential adverse effects, including drug -supplement 
interactions  
 
●Encouraging caregivers who want to try CAM therapies to try them one at a time and to monitor target 
goals and core symptoms to determine effect  
 
●Encouraging caregivers to determine a time frame in which they expect behavior changes to occur"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|12|18b6f61ef8c74896a889472b2dc3e6e6
"●Encouraging caregivers to use evidence -based behavioral interventions and/or medications at the 
same time that they are exploring CAM th erapies  
 
The clinician also can try to redirect patients and caregivers who are using potentially harmful CAM 
therapies (eg, megavitamins) to safer (if still unproven) lifestyle therapies (eg, yoga, massage therapy). 
(See ""Complementary and integrative health in pediatrics"", section on 'Discussing complementary 
therapies with patients and families'.)  
 
PROGNOSIS  
Most of the information about prognosis in children with ADHD is derived from small cohort studies of 
male patients who were evaluate d and treated for ADHD in psychiatric clinics [114,133 -140]. The 
generalizability of the information to other patient groups is limited. Long -term follow -up (six to eight 
years) of the Multimodal Treatment study of children with ADHD (MTA) study cohort sug gests that 
functioning during adolescence is predicted by the initial clinical presentation (including severity of 
symptoms and comorbid conduct problems), intellect, social advantage, and the strength of ADHD 
response to any mode of treatment [141]. Follo w-up into early adulthood (approximately 16 years after 
enrollment at a mean age of approximately 25 years) suggests that functioning in early adulthood is 
predicted by persistence of symptoms, baseline ADHD severity, intelligence quotient, and comorbidity"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|13|f1763c94dada48b492f575cd853ae0e6
"predicted by persistence of symptoms, baseline ADHD severity, intelligence quotient, and comorbidity  
[142,143], and that most children have a course with intermittent periods of remission and recurrence 
[144]. Early and effective management and support may be helpful in improving adult outcomes.  
 
●Persistence of symptoms – For most children with ADHD, AD HD symptoms fluctuate between 
childhood and young adulthood with intermittent periods of remission and recurrence. In prospective 
follow -up, 558 participants in the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD had eight assessments over 
time ranging from 2 to 16 yea rs after baseline [144]. At the study endpoint (mean age of 25.1 years), 64 
percent had fluctuating periods of remission and recurrence (full or partial), 16 percent had sustained 
partial remission, 9 percent had sustained remission, and 11 percent had per sistent ADHD (met ADHD 
criteria at all follow -ups). At any given follow -up, 40 to 50 percent of participants met ADHD criteria, 
consistent with findings from earlier studies [145 -150]. Factors associated with persistence of symptoms 
into adulthood include the severity of initial symptoms, coexisting mental health disorders, and parental 
mental health disorders [151,152]. (See ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: Epidemiology, 
clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"".)  
 
In another prospe ctive study, 70 percent of 88 children diagnosed with ADHD at a tertiary care clinic"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|13|a51737f08cae49f4acb42c030fb771f5
"In another prospe ctive study, 70 percent of 88 children diagnosed with ADHD at a tertiary care clinic 
before age seven continued to meet criteria for ADHD four to nine years later (median interval seven 
years) [19]. Among the 26 children who no longer met criteria for ADHD , new diagnoses included autism 
spectrum disorder (10 children), learning disorder (3 children), and anxiety disorder (2 children),"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|13|4e328db2cba54994a946f85fe00bf164
"highlighting the importance of monitoring young children diagnosed with ADHD for symptoms of other 
neurodevelopmental and be havioral disorders. (See 'Preschool children' above.)  
 
●Injury and self -injury – Children with ADHD or symptoms of ADHD are at greater risk for incurring 
intentional and unintentional injury than children without these symptoms [145,150,153 -159].  
 
•In a re view of medical, pharmaceutical, and disability claims for injuries or poisoning treatments, 
individuals with ADHD were more likely to have at least one claim related to unintentional injury than 
controls (28 versus 19 percent for children, 32 versus 23 pe rcent for adolescents, and 38 versus 18 
percent for adults) [153].  
 
•In nationwide cohort studies, ADHD was independently associated with increased mortality in children, 
adolescents, and adults [158,160]; most of the deaths were caused by unnatural causes , particularly 
unintentional injuries.  
 
•In a prospective study of 140 females with ADHD diagnosed at age 6 to 12 years (93 with combined 
type [ADHD -C], 47 with inattentive type [ADHD -I]), those with ADHD -C were more likely to have 
attempted suicide during  the 10 -year follow -up than those with ADHD -I or controls (22, 8, and 6 
percent, respectively) [150]. Self -injury was also more common among females with ADHD -C than 
females with ADHD -I or controls (51, 29, and 19 percent, respectively)."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|14|741e6f3a69494d669ae8debe3002334b
"females with ADHD -I or controls (51, 29, and 19 percent, respectively).  
 
Treatment with st imulant medications may mitigate this risk [161 -165]. In a study analyzing data from 
the Swedish national registers that included nearly 93,000 individuals (age 6 to 24 years) with ADHD, 
initiation of ADHD pharmacotherapy within three months of diagnosis v ersus non -initiation was 
associated with a reduction in two -year mortality risk from all -causes (13.5 versus 18.1 per 10,000 
individuals, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 -0.92), unnatural causes such as suicide, 
accidental poisoning or injury (11.7 versus 15.1 per 10,000 individuals, aHR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 -0.96), and 
natural causes (1.8 versus 2.9 per 10,000 individuals, aHR 0.63, 95% CI 0.35 -1.10), but the latter was not 
statistically significant [161]. The observational design does not account  for unmeasured confounders 
such as lifestyle factors or social support that could have contributed to the results.  
 
●Driving – Adolescents with ADHD are more likely than those without the disorder to have motor 
vehicle crashes (relative risk 1.9, 95% CI 1 .4-2.5 in a meta -analysis of five observational studies) 
[166,167]. The risk is particularly increased in the first months after obtaining a driver's license and may 
be related to risky driving behaviors (eg, speeding, not wearing a seatbelt, alcohol and/o r drug use)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|14|194aedc571284b2485b5978706332510
"be related to risky driving behaviors (eg, speeding, not wearing a seatbelt, alcohol and/o r drug use) 
[168]. Adolescents with ADHD also are more likely to have their driving licenses suspended or revoked. 
In randomized trials, driving performance improves with stimulant medication [166,169 -171]."|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|14|54486ef19a174c2b88c1e4d359be731a
"●Education – Follow -up studies of children with ADHD into adolescence consistently indicate impaired 
academic functioning (eg, completion of less schooling, lower achievement scores, failure of more 
courses) compared with controls [63,113,114,133,149,150,172 -176]. This is particularly true for children 
with the inattentive or combined presentation of ADHD [177]. In the few studies in which subjects were 
followed into adulthood, the findings persisted (25 to 33 percent of probands versus 1 to 9 percent of 
controls dropped out of high school; 15 to 19 perc ent of probands versus 50 to 64 percent of controls 
had completed a bachelor's or higher level degree) [133,136,137,140,178]. Impaired academic function 
appears to persist, even in those children who no longer meet criteria for diagnosis of ADHD in 
adolesc ence or adulthood [114].  
 
●Substance use – Children with ADHD may be at increased risk of engaging in substance use during 
adolescence and adulthood, particularly if they present with comorbid conduct disorder (CD) or 
oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). ( See ""Substance use disorder in adolescents: Epidemiology, clinical 
features, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Risk factors'.)  
 
Although individual longitudinal studies have had inconsistent results, a 2011 systematic review and 
meta -analysis of 27 p rospective longitudinal studies found that compared with children without ADHD, 
children with ADHD were at increased risk for [179]:"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|15|323e46ff45c1476999ba02a5bd04b8da
"children with ADHD were at increased risk for [179]:  
 
•Ever using nicotine (odd ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.7 -2.6) and nicotine dependence in adolescence or 
adulthood (OR 2.8, 95%  CI 2.4 -3.3) 
 
•Alcohol use disorder (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4 -2.2), but not ever use of alcohol  
 
•Ever using marijuana (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6 -4.7) and marijuana use disorder (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 -4.0) 
 
•Cocaine use disorder (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4 -3.0) 
 
•General illicit drug use (substances not explicitly specified, OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.8 -3.9) 
 
The effect sizes did not differ by average age at follow -up, sex, race, population (eg, general versus 
referral), or diagnostic criteria for ADHD. However, the majority of thes e studies did not assess comorbid 
ODD or CD and, based on 10 studies, children with comorbid ADHD and ODD or CD had more substance"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|15|bb2026c53270418588f745fb2603dae4
"abuse problems than children with only ADHD and controls [179]. In fact, 2 of these 10 studies report no 
increased risk for s ubstance abuse in ADHD beyond that explained by comorbid ODD and CD.  
 
The mechanism for the association between ADHD and substance use is not clear [180]. Proposed 
theories include impulsivity, poor judgment, and biologic vulnerability (perhaps related to dopamine 
transmission).  
 
The risk of engaging in substance use in adolescence or adulthood does not appear to be affected by the 
pharmacologic treatment of ADHD [181,182]. In a 2013 meta -analysis of 15 longitudinal studies (2565 
participants), stimulant tr eatment neither protected against nor increased the risk of subsequent 
substance use disorders [182]. These findings differ from those of a 2003 meta -analysis of six studies, 
which found a reduced risk of substance abuse disorders among individuals with AD HD who were 
treated with medications compared with those who were not [183]. Additional support for a lack of 
effect is provided by eight -year follow -up of participants in the MTA (not included in the meta -analyses), 
in which children (7 to 9.9 years old a t the time of enrollment) were randomly assigned to 14 months of 
medication, behavior therapy, combined medication and behavioral therapy, or standard community 
care [181]. No effect of medication for ADHD on subsequent substance use was found – whether"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|16|4dbd88ca953045458a8ccc85540a8b13
"care [181]. No effect of medication for ADHD on subsequent substance use was found – whether 
analyzed by original treatment group, medication at follow -up, or cumulative stimulant therapy.  
 
The lack of association between stimulant use and risk of subsequent substance use may not hold for 
youth who misuse prescription stimulants. A 2023 national lon gitudinal study of more than 5000 
adolescents enrolled in 12th grade and followed for six years evaluated the association between 
stimulant use and subsequent cocaine or methamphetamine use [184]. Participants who used 
stimulants as prescribed for ADHD the rapy at study entry were no more likely to start using cocaine or 
methamphetamine over the six -year follow -up period than participants who did not use stimulants. 
However, those who reported prescription stimulant misuse but no history of stimulant treatme nt for 
ADHD at study entry were more likely to have initiated cocaine or methamphetamine use compared 
with those who did not use stimulants at all (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.5 -4.6).  
 
●Employment – In studies that followed children with ADHD into early adulthood, th e rate of 
employment of ADHD probands did not differ from that of controls [136,137]. However, in a prospective 
male cohort that was followed for 33 years (mean age 41 years), fewer probands than controls were 
employed (83 versus 95 percent) [140]. Proband s were reported to have lower status jobs and to"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|16|5dd2be2ade5e4268b6ab04f7c6ecba63
"employed (83 versus 95 percent) [140]. Proband s were reported to have lower status jobs and to 
perform poorly compared with controls when rated by their employers in various areas of work 
performance [133,140].  
 
●Antisocial personality – Children who have ADHD are at increased risk to develop antisoci al personality 
disorder (ASPD) and behaviors in adulthood [133,140,185]. In studies that followed children with ADHD"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|16|f125e3a2c08044c6a2f39bbe50484e1c
"into adulthood, the prevalence of ASPD ranges from 12 to 23 percent in probands (predominantly with 
the hyperactive -impulsive presentation of ADHD) versus 2 to 3 percent in controls [134,136,137,140].  
 
The increased risk of developing ASPD appears to be independent of comorbid conduct disorder in 
childhood because children with comorbid problems were excluded from several study cohorts 
[135,1 36]. In an observational study, 54 percent of 147 ADHD patients self -reported having been 
arrested at least once by age 21 years (compared with 37 percent of 73 community controls); 24 percent 
of ADHD patients had been arrested for misdemeanors (compared w ith 11 percent of controls) and 27 
percent for felony (compared with 11 percent of controls) [185].

Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.  
 
SUMMARY AND RECOMME NDATIONS  
 
●General principles  
 
•Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic condition; education of patients, caregivers, 
and teachers regarding the diagnosis is an integral part of treatment. Management centers on the 
achievement of targe t outcomes, which are chosen in collaboration with the child, caregivers, and 
school personnel. Coexisting conditions must be treated concurrently with ADHD. (See 'General 
principles' above.)  
 
•Treatment of ADHD may involve psychosocial interventions, medication, and/or educational"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|17|e1f761d25f744e978484f7b20576fd4a
"principles' above.)  
 
•Treatment of ADHD may involve psychosocial interventions, medication, and/or educational 
interventions, alone or in combination. Decisions regarding the choice of therapy should involve the 
patient and their caregivers. (See 'Involvement of patient and ca regivers' above.)  
 
•ADHD in children 4 to 18 years of age without comorbid conditions can usually be managed by the 
primary care provider. Indications for referral to or consultation with a specialist (eg, developmental 
behavioral pediatrician, child neuro logist, psychopharmacologist, child psychiatrist, clinical child 
psychologist) may include (see 'Indications for referral' above):  
 
-Coexisting psychiatric conditions (eg, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, substance abuse, 
emotional problems )"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|17|719aa4fe9f5e441cab584620866bab15
"-Coexisting neurologic or medical conditions (eg, seizures, tics, autism spectrum disorder, sleep 
disorder)  
 
-Lack of response to a controlled trial of stimulant therapy or atomoxetine  
 
-Complex psychosocial context  
 
●Management approach  
 
•Preschool chi ldren – For preschool children (age 4 through 5 years) who meet the diagnostic criteria for 
ADHD, we recommend parent (or caregiver) training in behavior management (PTBM) rather than 
medication as the initial therapy (Grade 1A). For those who fail to resp ond to behavioral interventions 
alone, we suggest medications as an adjunct to behavioral interventions (Grade 2B). However, the 
values and preferences of the caregiver are critical factors in deciding whether to initiate medication. 
When medication is nec essary for preschool children, we suggest methylphenidate rather than 
amphetamines or nonstimulants (Grade 2B). (See 'Preschool children' above and 'Pharmacotherapy' 
above and ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment  with 
medications"", section on 'Preschool children'.)  
 
•School -aged children and adolescents – For most school -aged children (≥6 years) and adolescents with 
ADHD who meet specific criteria (table 3), we suggest pharmacotherapy rather than behavior therapy 
alone or no intervention (Grade 2A). However, decisions regarding the choice of therapy should involve"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|18|22cf9f9e20e14741a485b33460a6375c
"alone or no intervention (Grade 2A). However, decisions regarding the choice of therapy should involve 
the patient and their caregivers. When the decision is made to try medications, we suggest a stimulant 
as the first line agent (Grade 2B). (See 'School -age children' above and 'Pharmacotherapy' above and 
""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment with medications"", 
section on 'Choice of agent'.)  
 
For school -aged children (≥6 years) and adolescents with ADHD, we suggest  that psychosocial 
interventions be added to medication therapy (Grade 2C). Adding psychosocial interventions to 
stimulant therapy in school -aged children and adolescents does not provide additional benefit for core 
symptoms of ADHD, but may affect symptom s of coexisting conditions (eg, oppositional/aggressive 
behavior) and lower the dose of stimulant therapy necessary to achieve the desired effects. (See 
'Combination therapy' above.)  
 
●Monitoring – Children being treated for ADHD should be monitored regula rly for adherence to the 
treatment plan, achievement of target goals, occurrence of core symptoms, and adverse effects of 
therapy. The frequency of follow -up depends upon the management strategy. (See 'Monitoring' above.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|18|3dbabb10bebc436b985140ae4c744c46
"●School -based interventions – Children with ADHD may require changes in their educational 
programming, including tutoring, resource room support (either in an exclusive setting or within the 
classroom), classroom modifications, or direct skills training for adolescents. (See 'School -based  
interventions' above.)  
 
●Dietary interventions – We suggest not using elimination diets for most children with ADHD (Grade 
2C). However, a short trial (no more than five weeks) of an elimination diet may be an option for 
children with ADHD whose caregiver s are concerned about the use and potential side effects of 
pharmacologic agents and are motivated to comply with the diet. (See 'Elimination diets' above.)  
 
We suggest not using essential fatty acid supplementation for children with ADHD (Grade 2C). (See 
'Essential fatty acid supplementation' above.)  
 
●Prognosis – For most children with ADHD, ADHD symptoms fluctuate between childhood and young 
adulthood with intermittent periods of remission and recurrence. ADHD diagnosed in childhood is 
associated with increased rates of intentional and unintentional injury, substance use (particularly in 
those with comorbid oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder), and motor vehicle crashes 
among those who drive. (See 'Prognosis' above.)"|data_input/adhd_2/Treatment of children and adolescents.pdf|19|6263528450464c65835628214466fa34

 Systematic Review: Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants: R isk Factors, 
Outcomes, and Risk Reduc tion Strategies Iden tified Through a Sy stematic Review  
Abstract  
Objective: To review all literature on th e nonmedical use (NMU) and divers ion of 
prescription stimulants to better  understand the characteristic s, risk factors, and outcomes of 
NMU and review risk-reduction strategies. Method: We systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and SCOPUS from incep tion to 
May 2018 for studies containing empirical data about NMU and di version of prescription 
stimulants. Additional references  identified by the authors wer e also assessed for inclusion.  
Results: 109 studies met inclusion criteri a. NMU and diversion of stimul ants are highly 
prevalent; self-reported rates among population samples range f rom 2.1%–58.7% and 0.7%–
80.0%, respectively. A variety of terms are used to describe NM U, and most studies have 
examined college students. Wher eas most NMU is oral, non-oral N MU also occurs. The 
majority of NMU is associated wi th no, or minor, medical effect s; however adverse medical 
outcomes, including death, occur  in some individuals, particula rly when administered by non-
oral routes. Although academic a nd occupational performance enh ancement are the most 
commonly cited motivations, there  is little evidence that acade mic performance is improved 
by NMU in individual s without ADHD."|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|0|bbed2e99fe9e44ce82f94001f7a26ed4
"commonly cited motivations, there  is little evidence that acade mic performance is improved 
by NMU in individual s without ADHD.  
Conclusion: NMU of stimulants is a significant public h ealth problem, espec ially in college 
students, but variations in the terms used to describe NMU and inconsistencies in the 
available data limit a better understanding of this problem. Fu rther research is needed to 
develop methods that detect NMU , identify individuals at greate st risk, study routes of 
administration, and devise educat ional and other interventions to help reduce occurrence of 
NMU. Colleges should consider inc luding NMU in academic integri ty policies.

In the United States, Methylpheni date (MPH) and amphetamine (AM P) prescriptions 
increased 35.5% from 2008 to 2012.1, with the greatest rates of increase seen in adolescents 
and adults.  Because they enhance alertness and concentration a nd induce euphoria, these 
stimulants are associated with abuse, misuse and diversion2 and are classified as Schedule II 
controlled substances.3 In 2016, the number of individuals  aged ≥12 years in the Unite d 
States who reported initiating nonmedical use (NMU) of stimulan ts was 1.4 million, which 
was greater than the number of p eople initiating methamphetamin e and cocaine combined.4  
 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Assoc iation for Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) rec ommend that all adolescent pat ients should be assessed 
for symptoms of substance abuse,
5,6 and clinicians should monitor symptoms and prescription 
refill requests for signs of misu se and diversion in patients w ith ADHD.6 Similarly, the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recomm ends that providers 
consider the risks of stimulant misuse and diversion when presc ribing medications for 
ADHD.7  
 
The US Food and Drug Admi nistration (FDA) defines abuse  of prescription drugs as “the 
intentional, nontherapeutic use  of a drug product or substance,  even once, to achieve a 
desirable psychological or physiological effect.” Misuse  is defined as “the intentional"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|1|5733bd7058ab427c857dbb84441f651d
"desirable psychological or physiological effect.” Misuse  is defined as “the intentional 
therapeutic use of a drug product in an inappropriate way and s pecifically excludes the 
definition of abuse.”8 Diversion  is when medication prescribed  for one individual is sold, 
given to, or taken by another individual.9 Malingering  is when an individual fakes or 
exaggerates symptoms to gain some form of reward, for example a  prescription.10"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|1|08c29376c2804dfe9bdc9bb4f2b2c0b9
"3 
 Nonmedical use  is the use of a prescription stim ulant without a prescription, or in a way 
other than prescribed. NMU encom passes both abuse and misuse.11  
 
This review provides a systematic  overview of the NMU of prescr ibed stimulants across the 
lifespan. The intent is to consol idate what is known from previ ous research and reviews, 
augment with new information, and prioritize issues of importan ce for clinical practice and 
future research. We highlight ri sk factors and motivations for NMU and diversion, as these 
can aid in the identification of  high-risk patients, and the de velopment of more sophisticated 
approaches to management. We al so review what is known regardin g approaches to patient 
and/or parent education, as these can be crucial for the preven tion and treatment of NMU and 
diversion. Finally, we offer sugg estions for reducing the NMU a nd diversion of stimulant 
medications that can be implemented in clinical practice.

 Epidemiology of Stimulant NMU and Diversion 
We identified 86 studies address ing the epidemiology of NMU and /or diversion. Self-
reported rates of NMU among samp les of mainly adolescents and y oung adults varied 
dramatically depending on the definitions, methodology, and stu dy population ( Figure 2 ). 
Most studies used the term NMU, but this term may have referred  to misuse, abuse, or both, 
or it was not clearly defined.15,27,41,42,67   Several studies focused on diversion, with shopping 
behavior and feigning ADHD sympt oms studied less often. US data bases indicated an 
increase in reports of stimulant NMU during the past 25 years, particularly with 
AMP.30,45,46,64,65,71 The only population-based estima te of NMU (Compton et al.) use d data 
from the 2015–2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDU H), finding that ~5 
million (2.1%) adults (≥18 year s old) had engaged in stimulant NMU at least once in the past 
year.2  Details from individual st udies are provided online ( Tables S1, S2 and S3 ) 
 Most individuals who reported NM U (~50%–90%) obtained the medic ation from family or 
friends.
15,20,26,27,30,36,37,40,42,50,55,59,73,78,80,105,106,118 College peers are also an often-cited 
source.98,101,104,118, though the peer supplying the me dication is not always a frie nd 118 Many 
individuals (4%–35%) reported NMU of their own prescription sti mulant.20,26,27,40,69,73,118"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|4|96ce6241371645d6839372d27f2151c7
"individuals (4%–35%) reported NMU of their own prescription sti mulant.20,26,27,40,69,73,118 
Individuals often gave or sold t heir medications to family or f riends.9,14,44,63,67,82,83,89,108 
Finally, some individuals feign AD HD symptoms in order to recei ve a prescription from their 
health care provider.80 In addition, 20% of US adults r eporting past-yea r NMU indicate d that 
they had obtained prescripti ons fraudulently from a doctor.80 
 
College students often reported that obtaining stimulants is “e asy.101,118 Only in a few studies 
did students report having even a “slightly difficult” time acq uiring the medication.36,40,104,105 
Stimulant medication is often ac quired without pay ing, sometime s through theft. When"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|4|1a771902ed094630acf688528ca0648d

 purchased, the cost is usually low.13,15,37,105 Respondents infrequently cite a 
dealer/stranger26,30,36,40,59,73,106 or the internet as a source for obtaining stimulants.30,59,80 
 
The most frequently reported rout e of administration is oral (5 2%–95%).15,20,26,42,54,78,97,105,115 
Among 15,876 adults and adolescent s with AMP exposures who cont acted American 
Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) from 2012 to 2016 , 11,923 exposures were 
classified as abuse. Of these, 93.6% were via oral administrati on, followed by 5.0% and 1.3% 
for nasal and intravenous routes, respectively .115 
 Snorting (insufflation) was indi cated as a route of administrat ion at least some of the time by 
7%–48% of US college students who reported NMU.
15,19,20,38,42,50,54,55,78,97,105 In one of the 
above studies, 1%–6% and 1%–11% o f those reporting NMU endorsed  smoking or injecting 
stimulants, respectively.27 Similar proportions of oral and non-oral routes of administrat ion 
were reported among 147,816 adoles cents and adults being assess ed for substance abuse 
treatment, with 38% of those re porting NMU endorsing snorting, 10% endorsing injecting, 
and 3% endorsing smoking.26  
 
Based on the estimate that 5 mill ion US adults misused stimulan ts during 2015–2016 2 and 
the rates of non-oral NMU described above 27 we can estimate past -year non-oral NMU in 
US adults. As rates of insu fflation range from 11%–40%,27, we estimate that ~550,000–2"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|5|0964989402464cafab3cfcfb5e85a13a

 Risk Factors and Motivatio ns for NMU of Stimulants 
Risk Factors 
Figure 3  presents statistically significa nt predictors of past-year or lifetime NMU. NMU is 
most common among adults aged 18–25 years.27,30 In a study of 4,297 US adults, those aged 
18–25 years were significantly more  likely to report NMU than t hose aged 26–49 years.80  
Among middle and high school stu dents, those in higher grades w ere more likely to engage in 
NMU than those in lower grades.74 NMU of MPH was reported more frequently by students 
in 10th grade (4.6%) and 12th grade (5%) compared with 8th grad e (2.7%), even after 
controlling for demographic factors.74 Similar age-related trends have been observed in 
college-aged students.22,73 
 With some exceptions
20,74,80, most studies find males to be at greater risk for NMU than 
females, across all age groups 13,17,22,30,40,42,45,46,48,53,54,73,81,84,91,102.  Those who report NMU are 
more likely to be white.17,18,20,22,30,40,42,72-74,77,84,102  For example, a survey of 4,572 US high-
school seniors found the lifetime p revalence of NMU to be 11.2%  among white students, 
5.6% among Hispanic students and 2.9% among African-American st udents.77 Surveys of 
12,237 students in the 8th, 10th, and 12th grades found that wh ite students were six times 
more likely than African-Ameri can students to report NMU.74 
 There is an inverse correlation be tween grade point average (GP A) and NMU.

20,73,74 A study 
of 9,161 college students found that those with GPAs <3.5 had s ignificantly greater odds of 
misusing stimulants than other students.73 Longitudinal data show tha t academic difficulties 
lead to NMU of stimulants as stud ents try to keep up academical ly.18  Among college 
students, those associated with fraternities or sororities are more likely than others to report 
NMU.22,73,84,85,104"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|6|77efe3033ce841e39806c3f563fb76a2

Individuals who report NMU have h igher levels of ADHD symptoms than those who do 
not.9,17,18,22,57,81,84,99,101,106- though the self-report nature o f the data cannot rule out 
confounding from malingering. A l ongitudinal study of college s tudents found that 17% of 
those reporting NMU had high leve ls of self-reported ADHD sympt oms17 A national cross-
sectional survey of more than 4,000 US adults found similar res ults. However, a small 
minority of studies did not find an association between ADHD sy mptoms and NMU.55,89,103 
 
NMU has also been associated with  use of other substances and s ubstance-use 
disorders.17,18,27,29,31,36,43,50,57,59,72,73,77,83,84,87,89,102,106,108, 119 In a population sample of 6,103 
adults who reported past-year NMU , concurrent abuse was most fr equently reported for 
alcohol (64.2%), followed by marijuana (43.6%), cocaine (10.6%) , tranquilizer s/sedatives 
(8.8%), hallucinogens (8.4%), heroin (2.5%), inhalants (2.3%), and pain relievers (2.1%).29 A 
study of 2,203 adolescents and an other of 984 college students reported similar results 18,31  
 Some studies have found that indi viduals who report NMU are mor e likely to have eating 
disorders 
51,59,109 For example, among 707 college st udents without a prescription  for 
stimulants, respondents who used s timulants for weight loss had  more symptoms of eating 
disorders than those who did not.59

Academic motivations were cite d by 50%–89% of college students who reported NMU and 
were the most common motiv ations in almost every

 representative sample of 10,000 US adults.27  The above figures are in line with the 
acknowledged motivation for NMU . However, the second most commo nly cited reason for 
NMU is recreation.  Approximately 2%–31% of college s tudents reported “getting high ” as a 
motivation for NMU.13,15,36,40,49,55,83,97,101,118,119 A survey of 4,580 college students found that 
31% of those reporting NMU did so  to “get high.” This motivatio n varies by race; in one

 Outcomes of Stimulant NMU 
Stimulant NMU is associated with the same adverse effects repor ted in clinical trials ( online  
Table S5 ).13,55,83,84  These effects, include headach e, stomachache, irritability, f eeling sad, 
reduced appetite, sleep difficult ies and dizziness. These effec ts were slightly higher among 
prescription holders compared wi th nonprescription holders. For  example, among 299 US 
college students reporting NMU, the percentage of individuals r eporting an unwanted effect 
was substantially higher among t hose with a prescription compar ed with those without a 
prescription.55  
 
Medical Outcomes  
NMU of stimulants places a substantial burden on health care fa cility 
utilization.30,45,46,64,65,71,90,115  Data from the Drug Abuse Wa rning Network (DAWN) found 
that the number of emergency room  (ER) visits related to NMU by  adults increased from 
5,212 in 2005 to 15,585 in 2010; there was no increase in visit s by children.71 NSDUH and 
DAWN data from 2006 to 2011 found that ER visits involving AMP increased by 67% and 
156%, respectively. There was not  a comparable change in ER vis its for MPH; among 
adolescents, trends remaine d stable or decreased.30  A study of 15,629 adults and adolescents 
with AMP exposures reported to poison control centers found gre ater rates of admission to 
health care facilities among individuals who abused versus thos e who did not abuse AMP.115"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|9|7a1d018dd5e94e36aa9fbf37800f2167

Among those who abused AMP, half of admissions were to a critic al care unit.115 
 
While the majority of stimulant NMU reported to poison control centers was associated with 
no medical effects or minor toxi city, a notable percentage were  associated with adverse 
medical outcomes ( Table 1 ). Regional and national databa se analyses found that MPH and 
AMP were associated with clinica lly significant effects in appr oximately 35% of NMU"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|9|0b43394c61c24208acb422e616a586ba

 exposures in adolescents.45,46,65,90 These effects were defin ed as moderate (pronounced, 
prolonged symptoms) or major (symp toms that are life-threatenin g or produce significant 
disability or disfigurement) and included deaths. The severity of stimulant exposures appears 
to have increased over time; the percentage of adolescent poiso n control calls associated with 
clinically significant effects r ose from 30% to 43% from 1998 t o 2005.90  
 Data from poison control centers show a significantly greater r isk of adverse medical 
outcomes among adults and adolesce nts abusing AMP versus non-ab users of AMP.  This risk 
varied by route of administrati on. For example, the odds of dyi ng were 13 times greater 
among nasal abusers (3 out of 598 died [0.5%]) and 22 times gre ater among intravenous 
abusers (2 out of 164 died [1.2%]) versus nonabusers (1 out of 3,953 died [0.03%]).
115 Mean 
numbers of adverse medical outcom es were highest for intravenou s use (2.95), followed by 
nasal (2.46) and oral (2.17) us e, and by non-abuse exposures (1 .57).115 
 
Academic Outcomes  
While improving academic performance is an often-cited motivati on for NMU, stimulant 
NMU has not been shown to impro ve academic performance in those  without a diagnosis of 
ADHD.81 A  longitudinal study of 8,362 adolescents found that 35-year-o ld individuals who

 Methods to Reduce the NMU of Stimulants 
 A survey of 826 US pediatricians found that 46% and 44% reporte d that they educated 
adolescent patients on health and  legal risks of stimulant NMU “often” or “very often,” 
respectively
33,34; 40% provided no education regarding diversion and NMU when pa tients 
began college.34 Many pediatricians did not often  use prevention strategies, ev en when they 
suspected NMU or diversion.33 However, 89% prescribed long -acting stimulants and 27% 
prescribed non-stimulants (atom oxetine or alpha-2 agonists) to prevent NMU often or very 
often, with both percentages inc reasing when NMU or diversion w ere suspected.33 Another 
study found that 25% and 48% of surveyed physicians did not fee l qualified to educate on the 
health or legal consequences of NMU and diversion, respectively .113 
 
Challenging unrealisti c expectations of pe rformance enhancement  may reduce NMU.11 A 
study of 96 stimulant-naïve colle ge students with at least two risk factors for  NMU found that 
challenging the positive expectan cies of NMU successfully alter ed perceptions about 
stimulant effects, but a deterre nt effect was not  maintained af ter 6 months.111 A single-college 
study showed that students assigne d to read information about t he negative academic or 
health effects of NMU reported th e lowest willingness to use st imulants; however, long-term 
effects on actual us e were not measured.94"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|11|507ce8c273ee4f91a9858f2f7f69e505

 A study of 2,313 college student s followed over four semesters found that when health care

behavior.
38 Thus, it may be beneficial to q uestion college-aged patients i f they ever share, or 
feel pressure to share, their stimulants.38 This may be particularly helpful for patients at high

 stimulants be carefully screened for ADHD and substance-use dis order, because risk for these 
conditions may be elevated in students with stimulant NMU.106 
 
Very little is known about the eff ectiveness of institutional p olicies as a potential tool for 
addressing the NMU of stimulants.  Aikins et al. 120 examined the academic integrity policies 
and alcohol/drug use policies o f 200 institutions of higher edu cation.  They found 191 
academic integrity policies but o nly one of these addressed the  NMU of stimulants.  Among 
200 alcohol/drug use policies, 198 addressed the NMU of stimula nts.  The authors point out 
that this approach essentially treats NMU only as a legal issue , not as an issue of academic 
integrity.  It is possible that defining NMU of stimulants for cognitive enhancement as a form 
of academic dishonesty could be a  deterrent, but no research ha s addressed that issue.  Also, 
because the use of stimulants a s cognitive enhancers is, in par t, a reaction to societal 
pressures to seek high levels of achievement and to overcome pe rsonal shortcomings at all 
costs121, changing this culture of high  expectations could reduce the d emand for performance 
enhancing drugs.  Several studies examined the iss ue of ADHD malingering in relat ion to NMU of stimulants.

 outcomes associated with NMU of s timulants raises concerns for specific subpopulations, 
especially young adults and colle ge students. Physicians who pr escribe stimulants or work 
with high-risk populations should consider taking preventive me asures, especially for high-
risk subgroups.  Colleges and un iversities should consider univ ersal education of incoming 
students. As the publication date s for many of the identified s tudies indicate, the warning 
signs of a potential stimulant NMU crisis have been signaling f or at least a decade. These 
signs regarding the prevalence of  stimulant NMU, routes of admi nistration, and outcomes are 
evident in the main findings from this systematic review.   
 Our review shows that the prevale nce of prescription stimulant NMU ranges from 2.1% to 
58.7%, depending on study design , population, and definition us ed. Although NMU often 
represents sporadic attempts at performance enhancement or brie f experimentation, such use 
carries potentially serious risks, especially for cardiac event s among nonmedical users who 
have not been screened for preex isting cardiac conditions.  Thi s concern is supported by data 
from Poison Control Centers indic ating that NMU has been associ ated with serious health 
outcomes including critical care hospitalizations, suicide and other causes of death.  Although 
the most adverse outcomes are rar e, trends in NMU suggest they may increase given that the"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|13|86ef47ebf9654b9dbc6c94e594b1e00d

37 Data for other age 
groups and for young adults who do not attend college are lacki ng. This is an important gap 
in the literature because rates of and reasons for NMU vary by age. The sparse data for other 
young adults and adolescents indica te a substantial prevalence of NMU. We know almost 
nothing about the NMU of stimula nts in older adults.  Because a dvancing age is also"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|13|ee5b9ea2d5df4926839bfc8b37105f98

 associated with cardiovascular d isease, it is possible that NMU  leads to a higher rate of 
adverse medical outcomes co mpared with younger patients. 
 
While most NMU of stimulants is via oral administration, a subs tantial minority occurs via 
non-oral routes.  Based on the da ta reviewed, we computed that approximately 550,000 to 
two million US adults administer stimulants intranasally, 50,00 0 to 300,000 smoke 
stimulants, and 50,000 to 550,000 inject stimulants.27 Although relevant supporting data are 
sparse, non-oral routes of admini stration appear to greatly inc rease the risks for severe and/or 
potentially catastrophic outcomes.115  One suspects that non-oral N MU could be a gateway to 
the non-oral use of illicit drugs but no data are available to address that issue.  
 Using Education to Prevent NMU  and Diversion of Stimulants 
Patient education is the first-lin e treatment for NMU and diver sion, yet many clinicians do 
not educate patients about the h ealth or legal consequences of these activities and do not feel 
qualified to do so.
34,113 There are several goals of pati ent education.  Patients need t o learn the 
medical and legal consequences o f diverting their medication or  using it in a non-prescribed 
manner.  It may be useful to teach  patients with ADHD that dive rsion of their medications is 
a felony and that diversion could be fatal when diverted to a p erson who is medically at risk"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|14|870a2d38b34a47539fc3a15de2f1f9c6
"a felony and that diversion could be fatal when diverted to a p erson who is medically at risk 
for cardiovascular disease.     Education about NMU and diversio n of stimulants is relevant for  all ages.  Although young 
children are unlikely to divert medications, their medications can be diverted and misused by 
their parents or older siblings .  Patients and parents need to learn how to protect their 
medications (e.g., don’t carry ext ra pills, keep medications hi dden and locked away).  To 
reduce diversion, patients can be taught specific responses whe n friends or siblings request"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|14|56583c9343e645d496ef9cecce1349d5

 their medications.  Patient and pa rent education benefits from repetition and use of more than 
one modality (e.g., discussions w ith health care professionals,  printed handouts).  It is 
especially important to address these issues just before patien ts leave for college.   
 
Preventive strategies should also focus on nonpatient populatio ns at risk of NMU, most 
notably high school and college students and other young adult populations.  A major 
emphasis is to correct common mi sperceptions about NMU.  Colleg e students overestimate 
the prevalence of misuse in peer s, which may normalize the beha vior and make them more 
likely to engage in NMU.20,38,94   The excuse that “everyone is doing it” is simply not true.  
Also, the message that NMU does not improve academic performanc e may be helpful.  NMU 
and diversion in college might a lso be reduced if colleges and universities defined the NMU 
of stimulants for cognitive enha ncement as a form of academic d ishonesty, with appropriate 
sanctions. This approach would pot entially be relevant to many students and could be 
communicated in writing and verba lly to all incoming students d uring orientation.

 Prescribing Medications for ADHD  when Diversion or NMU of Stimu lants is a Concern 
When embedded in an appropriate  educational approach, modificat ions to stimulant therapy 
can be useful for reducing NMU.  O ne idea is to prescribe long- acting stimulants, which have 
lower abuse potential than imm ediate-release stimulants.33,34 But, because long-acting 
stimulants are still susceptible to NMU (e.g., some individuals  may use them for performance 
enhancement), the non-stimulants ( atomoxetine or alpha-2 agonis ts) should be given a greater 
priority than they would for the  average patient.  If an accept able level of efficacy can be 
obtained, non-stimulants are id eal because they are not typical ly diverted or misused.  
 Our review uncovered several safeguards that prescribers can im plement in routine care to 
reduce the likelihood of NMU of stimulants – although each appr oach is associated with 
challenges.  Ideally, physicians should implement a medication contract which describe the 
risks of NMU and diversion and co mmits the patient to avoid the se problems within the 
context of a well-defined trea tment program.  However, managing  a medication contract and 
handling breaches of these comm itments can be difficult.  Enfor cement can be especially 
effective if implemented by colleges via clearly defined rules.   Reducing the number of pills 
per prescription (e.g., weekly vs . monthly supplies) decreases the patient’s supply for"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|16|ef3123978a6a4664873ed659af2d0f5b

diversion and NMU. However, limit ing the number of pills per pr escription could also lead to 
lapses in treatment and would s eem to penalize individuals who do not misuse their 
medications. Using pill counts (w hen patients should still have  pills remaining) can help 
physicians detect diver sion or NMU but not in all cases.  The A merican Academy of 
Pediatricians recommends that cl inicians monitor symptoms and p rescription refill requests 
for signs of misuse and diversion.

 Prescription drug monitoring pro grams (now available in all sta tes) help physicians identify 
patients seeking stimulant prescriptions from multiple sources.  We do not know of any 
mandated training initiatives foc used on prevention of NMU. One  program currently in 
development aims to produce stra tegies for primary care provide rs to reduce the diversion of 
prescription stimulants.120 Future initiatives could help i ncrease knowledge about NMU and  
the motivations and personality traits associated with NMU.     
Goals for Future Research 
More research is urgently need ed.  The published literature abo ut the NMU of stimulants is in 
its infancy. It is almost entirely descriptive, with very littl e published about the effectiveness 
of specific interventions to prev ent or treat NMU of stimulants  or their diversion.  We 
especially need research to st udy non-pharmacologic approaches to these problems.  For 
example, cognitive behavior ther apy modules could be developed to specifically focus on the 
cognitive and behavioral skills n eeded to prevent stimulant NMU  and diversion.   
 Future research should adopt the F DA definitions of abuse and m isuse so there is consistent 
terminology across studies and publications. 
 Furthermore, future wo rk should develop NMU 
detection tools and validate inte rventions designed to mitigate  risk.  Future work should also 
develop tools that clinicians can use to screen for NMU.  Clini cians need such tools so that"|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|17|b0d12fb16b5d4898a037a4fa9a555d28

prevention and treatment strategies can be targeted to those at  highest risk for stimulant

tendencies for NMU of stimulan ts and might also aid in detectio n of malingering.  We found 
no studies of methods or tools specific to identifying stimulan t NMU. Such tools would be 
very useful for clinical work and research, although toxicology  screens are available for use 
when substance abus e is suspected."|data_input/adhd_2/Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants.pdf|17|e7112cf96b10486b955a63dd1c3d3a1b

Several limitations impact our con clusions. Many studies used s elf-report questionnaires 
and/or interviews, whi ch are prone to underreporting because of  the stigma and potential 
negative consequences a ssociated with NMU. Most studies were co nducted among college 
students. Regional and national da tabases are frequently used t o assess NMU, yet they cannot 
estimate population prevalence.122 Moreover, these databases lac k insights into key details, 
such as motivation and intent. Data from poison control centers  and DAWN provide useful 
insights but are inherently biase d because all cases analyzed a re those in which an individual 
has contacted the center or has b een admitted to a hospital. Th us, individuals who die from 
stimulant overdoses before contacting emergency services are no t entered into these 
databases, nor are those who are fearful of exposing their NMU or who experience minor 
unwanted effects.   
This review benefits from a broa d scope and consolidates the li terature on NMU across study 
designs, countries, and ages. How ever, this comprehensive appro ach is also a limitation. 
Because of the heterogeneity of  included studies, a meta-analys is was not appropriate, and 
comparing studies is difficult. A s is the case with all systema tic reviews, certain foci in the 
literature may have been missed by our search strategy.

Professionals generally don’t prescribe 
medication or other treatment until 
they understand your child’s mental 
health challenges and have made a diagnosis. 
The best way to do this is with a thorough, 
professional evaluation of your child and 
discussion with your family.
A basic assessment includes a detailed history 
of your child, family, and environment that 
can take up to two hours. This assessment 
will provide important information that will 
help the practitioner in deciding what may be 
affecting your child. Children under 12 years 
old may not be good at describing their own 
symptoms. Therefore, parents play a critical role 
in describing their child's ADHD symptoms.
Your Child’s Assessment May Include:
• Developmental history
• Medical/neurological history
• Family history of diagnosed or  
suspected mental health, learning, or 
substance use problems
• Current and past academic functioning
• Peer relationships
• Parent and teacher rating scales for  
ADHD and other symptoms
• Cognitive or neuropsychological testing
Diagnosis and Treatment Plan
Understanding how and when a child’s 
problems occur is important. This information

"your child. It is also important to consider a 
child’s developmental stage, in understanding 
whether a behavior is normal for their age or 
a sign of ADHD. If ADHD is diagnosed at the age of six years or older, most research shows 
that medication is the most effective treatment 
compared to other treatments. However, 
for preschoolers with symptoms of ADHD, 
techniques (known as behavior modification) 
that change behavior patterns at home and 
school should be considered before using 
medication. Often, medication is used together 
with parent management training (a training 
technique to change parenting behaviors), 
counseling, behavior modification, and/or 
family therapy.
Generally, children considered for medication 
to treat ADHD will benefit from a thorough 
medical checkup before starting on 
medication, including a physical examination 
by their pediatric practitioner to ensure that: 
1) the child is well; 2) an underlying medical 
problem is not causing the child’s difficulties or 
making ADHD worse; and 3) no major medical 
problems, such as heart conditions, would 
complicate the use of medications.Basics of a Child and Adolescent

Psychoeducation • Psychoeducation helps individuals with ADHD and their families learn 
about the disorder and its treatments.
• Being well-informed about the disorder helps parents be active 
decision makers in their children’s treatment. 
School-based 
accommodations• School-based accommodations should be considered for children with 
ADHD who struggle to complete homework, have learning issues, have 
difficulty paying attention in class, and/or difficulty finishing tests. 
• For more information, see AACAP’s Facts for Families: School 
Services for Children with Special Needs: Know Your Rights .
Psychotherapy • Behavioral-based therapies are structured talk therapies that aim 
to help children and their parents identify and unlearn problem 
behaviors (for example, getting mad and yelling at others) while 
learning new healthier behaviors and ways to cope with stress.
• Behavior management training for parents of younger children, as 
well as behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapies for school-aged 
youth, can be effective forms of ADHD treatment.
• In preschoolers, parent training is advised first, with medication 
reserved for those who still have significant behavior problems."|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|1|0a7eb0b8b3c44ce9b444594b4de264eb

medications for ADHD. They include 
both amphetamine (Adderall, 
Vyvanse, Dexedrine, and others) and 
methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, 
Focalin, and others). (See Table 1 
for full list.)  Research shows that 
methylphenidate and amphetamine may 
each work slightly differently in the brain 
to produce their effects. This means 
that one stimulant may work better than 
another to reduce your child’s ADHD 
symptoms or one may have fewer side 
effects. For example, if your child tries 
Ritalin or Concerta and has disappointing 
results, he or she may instead respond 
very well to Vyvanse, Adderall XR, or 
Dexedrine, and vice versa.
How stimulants work in the brain.  Cells 
in the brain use chemical messengers 
(neurotransmitters) to communicate 
with each other. Stimulant medications 
reduce ADHD symptoms by improving 
communication between brain cells. They 
do this by making neurotransmitters more available to boost the “signal.” 
Stimulants affect the availability of 
certain neurotransmitters—dopamine and 
norepinephrine—that play an important 
role in attention. 
Forms and dosing. The good news is 
that there are many forms (preparations) 
of stimulants available; however, this can 
make remembering the subtle differences 
among them more complicated. One of 
the biggest differences among stimulant"|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|2|4771cedf276f47819f7b8a25d12b99a7
"make remembering the subtle differences 
among them more complicated. One of 
the biggest differences among stimulant 
preparations is the length of time that 
the stimulant works. In general, there are 
shorter- and longer-acting stimulants, 
and they all have approximately the 
same effectiveness (see Table 1) . 
Once a correct dose of the stimulant 
medication is achieved, you will probably 
see its effect on your child’s attention 
and behavior within 30–60 minutes after 
taking the stimulant. For the shorter-
acting (immediate-release) stimulants, 
these effects usually last about 4 hours 
after the medication is taken. Because 
this action is relatively short, often 2 or 3 
doses per day are required. Many parents 
prefer the longer-acting (extended-release)

have to take a dose during the school day. 
Extended-release preparations usually 
start to work within an hour, though it 
takes longer for the medication to have 
its greatest effect. Overall, the effects 
of extended-release preparations last 
for 10–12 hours, depending on how the 
medication is prepared (for example, as 
a tablet or capsule). Often, a single dose 
in the morning will last the entire school 
day and into the evening. Sometimes, your 
practitioner will prescribe both a short- and 
a long-acting stimulant preparation to 
cover your child’s day. A newer preparation, 
Jornay (delayed- and extended-release 
methylphenidate), allows giving one 
bedtime dose to cover the next day.
Establishing the correct dose. To arrive 
at the proper dose of your child’s stimulant 
medication, the prescriber will start with 
a low dose and gradually increase it until 
you and the child’s teachers observe a 
noticeable improvement in your child's 
ADHD symptoms, or until the dose 
cannot be increased anymore because of side effects that your child may be 
experiencing. Because amphetamines are 
stronger than methylphenidate, the typical 
doses are less. If your child is experiencing 
a return of ADHD symptoms during the 
day, many prescribers suggest switching 
from an immediate- to an extended-
release stimulant. Often, doses higher than"|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|3|6755724e09db434f860762c32769ef76
"day, many prescribers suggest switching 
from an immediate- to an extended-
release stimulant. Often, doses higher than 
the minimum dose work better to improve 
both attention and behavior.
Drug interactions with stimulants.  You 
should always tell your prescriber about 
any prescribed and over-the-counter 
medications and supplements that your 
child takes. However, there are essentially 
no drugs that interact with stimulant 
medications, which would prevent the 
stimulant from working. Most over-
the-counter medications can be used 
safely alongside stimulants, although 
sometimes decongestants taken along 
with stimulants may cause jitteriness. 
Although certainly not encouraged, 
there are also no major interactions of 
stimulants with substances of abuse, 
including alcohol and marijuana."|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|3|6cde38ec073448aea89b73d9dadd28b7

Management Strategies for Stimulant-Related Side Effects
Side Effect Management
Loss of appetite 
(anorexia), weight loss• Monitor weight and don’t worry if your child doesn’t eat as much, as long as they are on a 
normal growth curve. You may see an initial loss of appetite that improves over time as your child 
continues to take the medication (for example, after 4–6 months of taking the medication).
• Give stimulant with meals.
• Add calorie-enhanced snacks (for example, instant breakfast, frozen yogurt, cereal), especially in 
the evening.
• Don’t force meals.
Difficulty falling asleep 
(insomnia)• Encourage good sleep habits such as waking at the same time daily, no caffeine, limiting naps to 
less than 45 minutes, and limiting use of electronic devices at bedtime.
• Give your child stimulants earlier in the day.
• Change to shorter-acting forms (for example, Concerta to Metadate CD).
• Stop afternoon or evening dose.
• Talk to your child’s practitioner about melatonin, low-dose clonidine or guanfacine, periactin, or 
mirtazepine at bedtime.
Dizziness • Do not give the next dose and talk to your child’s practitioner.
• Have your child’s blood pressure and heart rate checked.
• Have your child drink more fluids; encourage a midday snack.
• Talk with your child’s practitioner to consider changing to an extended-release form (Adderall XR, 
Ritalin LA, Concerta, Vyvanse)."|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|4|4854f331f4cf4bb7b2a5118f0dd21f42
"• Talk with your child’s practitioner to consider changing to an extended-release form (Adderall XR, 
Ritalin LA, Concerta, Vyvanse).
More irritability or 
moodiness when  
taking medication• Talk to your child’s practitioner about further understanding when your child is getting moody.
• Consider changing the preparation or type of the medication, or seeing if there is a separate 
mood problem.
Growth problems • Measure your child’s height and weight at least every 6 months.
• Talk with your child’s practitioner. You may want to discuss weekend and vacation times on lower 
doses or completely off medication.
Heart symptoms:  
heart pounding, 
dizziness, almost 
passing out, chest pain• Stop medication and notify practitioner immediately."|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|4|fc6896533a474ae09437ffc023849d6d
"12       Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):  Parents’ Medication GuideEffectiveness.  Approximately three-
quarters of children with ADHD will 
experience a decrease in their symptoms 
after taking a stimulant. In general, one 
can expect a 40–50% reduction in the 
symptoms of ADHD, along with noticeable 
improvement in their performance at 
school and in homework completion, 
as well as peer and family interactions. 
Unfortunately, medication does not 
provide a child with organizational skills or 
overcome a learning disability.
Side effects. You can expect your child to 
experience some side effects while taking 
stimulants; the most common ones often 
can be managed. Table 2  lists these side 
effects, along with strategies to help your 
child manage them. Some of the side 
effects are described in more detail below.
Weight and height issues.  Weight loss 
of less than 5 pounds within the first 6 
months of starting stimulants is generally 
not concerning. Although most research 
has found that stimulant treatment 
can slightly decrease a child's growth, 
it gradually stops having these minor 
effects after about 3 years of treatment. 
One way to reduce the stimulant's 
effects on growth is to have your child 
occasionally take time off from using the 
medication (for example, taking a break 
from the stimulant when on vacation). 
The possible benefits of time without 
medication must be balanced with a 
possible return of ADHD symptoms."|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|5|9d63a1694075441d877c2c74191eb735
"from the stimulant when on vacation). 
The possible benefits of time without 
medication must be balanced with a 
possible return of ADHD symptoms.
Sleep issues. If your child does not sleep 
well at night, stimulant medications 
may not work as well during the day. 
Good sleep practice should be tried 
first to improve sleep. Many youth with 
ADHD have sleep problems even without 
medication. If your child is having sleep 
problems caused by stimulants, changes 
in the medication’s form, dose, and timing 
may improve these problems. However, 
if the current stimulant routine is working 
well otherwise, your child’s prescriber 
may suggest adding a low dose of 
another medication, such as melatonin, 
clonidine, mirtazapine (Remeron), or 
imipramine, to help sleep.
Other side effects.  Other side effects of 
stimulant medications include headaches 
and stomachaches. Headaches that occur soon after the morning stimulant 
dose often require changing the form 
(for example, liquid or tablet forms) or 
the type of stimulant if they persist. 
Headaches experienced later in the day 
may be a result of not drinking enough 
water and/or not eating enough food. 
Stomachaches are often addressed 
by giving stimulant medication with or 
after breakfast or by using antacids, 
as needed. Less frequent side effects 
include becoming unnaturally quiet 
(parents sometimes call this the “zombie” 
effect because the child seems so 
different) and over-focused, or repeated"|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|5|e6e6552133104901b31f4bd29bee94fd
"(parents sometimes call this the “zombie” 
effect because the child seems so 
different) and over-focused, or repeated 
movements (tics or habits, such as 
picking the nails or skin).
One very rare risk of stimulant use is that 
it can worsen heart problems. Because of 
this risk, your child’s practitioner will ask 
questions about your child’s medical history, 
such as whether the child or a  
family member has had heart problems, 
dizziness, irregular heartbeats, shortness 
of breath, or chest pain. If any of these 
problems are present, further medical 
assessment before starting stimulants 
is suggested. If your child is taking any 
medication and develops these issues, 
contact your child’s practitioner immediately.
One persistent myth is that stimulants 
may increase the risk for later substance 
use problems. Instead, long-term studies 
have found that those who have had early 
and long-term treatment with stimulants 
have lower  risk of later cigarette or illegal 
substance use. However, the misuse of 
stimulants including selling or giving away, 
taking higher than recommended doses, 
using with substances of misuse as well 
as use in those without a prescription has 
been reported particularly in high school 
and college students and may happen 
more in students who are also using 
other substances. Careful monitoring of 
the medication, safe storage, education

use of extended release stimulants may"|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|5|5c4a14a00a9a448bbceb571caa9e21ec

"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):  Parents’ Medication Guide       13nonstimulant medications that may be 
considered. In some cases, your child’s 
practitioner may decide to start with a 
nonstimulant because of issues such as 
your child’s age, height, or other medical 
or mental health problems. In general, 
the nonstimulants are somewhat less 
effective than the stimulants; however, 
they tend to treat ADHD throughout the 
day with minimal effects on appetite 
or sleep  (see Table 3 for side effects) . 
Sometimes a nonstimulant may be used 
together with a stimulant medication to 
improve effects and reduce side effects.
Atomoxetine (Strattera)  is approved by 
the FDA for the treatment of ADHD in 
children, adolescents, and adults. It works 
by increasing the amount of certain 
neurotransmitters—norepinephrine 
(and dopamine)—available for cells to 
communicate with each other in the 
brain. Unlike the stimulants, atomoxetine 
is not a controlled substance, which 
makes it easier to obtain a several-month 
supply of medication.
Atomoxetine may be helpful in children 
and adolescents who do not respond to 
and/or cannot tolerate the side effects of 
stimulants. It has been studied not only in 
individuals who have ADHD alone, but also 
in those who have ADHD plus other mental 
health conditions. For example, children 
who have both ADHD and anxiety or tics 
may benefit from the use of atomoxetine, 
as it is helpful not only in treating the"|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|6|234f3d9f47334c5eae8c13d168d657a0
"who have both ADHD and anxiety or tics 
may benefit from the use of atomoxetine, 
as it is helpful not only in treating the 
ADHD symptoms but also in improving the 
anxiety and/or tics.
Establishing the correct dose.  Doses 
of atomoxetine should be started low 
and increased slowly to avoid excessive 
tiredness. Weight is an important factor in 
atomoxetine dosing. No blood monitoring 
of atomoxetine levels or other blood tests 
are necessary. Unlike stimulants where 
their effect is seen within hours at the right 
dose, it may take a few weeks at the right 
dose to see an effect with atomoxetine.
Drug interactions. Atomoxetine is broken 
down (metabolized) in the liver, and 
there are some possible interactions 
with other medicines, so you should ask 
your child’s practitioner before starting 
other medications. Likewise, if your 
child is prescribed atomoxetine, remind  the practitioner of the other medicines or 
supplements your child is already taking.
Viloxazine (Qelbree)  is newly approved 
by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD 
in children and adolescents. It works by 
increasing the amount of certain chemical 
messengers (norepinephrine) that are 
available for brain cells to communicate 
with each other. It also alters how other 
chemical messengers (serotonin) work in 
the brain. Unlike the stimulants, viloxazine 
is not a controlled substance. It has been 
used for years in Europe for the treatment 
of depression in adults."|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|6|075789c4309f4110935e5b2bc6db4809
"is not a controlled substance. It has been 
used for years in Europe for the treatment 
of depression in adults. 
Viloxazine may be helpful for children 
and adolescents who do not experience 
improvements in ADHD symptoms after 
taking stimulants and/or who cannot 
tolerate the side effects of stimulants. 
It may also be useful for children and 
adolescents who have other co-occurring 
mental health issues. 
Establishing the correct dose.  Doses 
of viloxazine should be started low and 
increased slowly so that your child does 
not experience too many side effects. Your 
child’s age (child or adolescent) will be 
taken into consideration by the practitioner 
when deciding on a dose. When taking 
viloxazine, no blood tests or monitoring 
of drug levels in the blood will be needed. 
Keep in mind that viloxazine may take 
a few weeks to have noticeable effects 
on your child’s ADHD symptoms, unlike 
stimulants that have effects within hours 
(at the right dose). 
Drug interactions.  There are some possible 
interactions of viloxazine with other 
medicines, so you should ask your child’s 
doctor before starting other medications. 
When having foods or drinks that contain 
caffeine, viloxazine may increase the levels 
of caffeine and, in turn, increase its effects. 
If your child is prescribed viloxazine, remind 
the practitioner about the potential for a 
drug interaction.

used in adults to decrease high blood 
pressure) include clonidine (Kapvay, 
Catapres) and guanfacine (Intuniv, Tenex). 
These medications may also help with 
sleep or tic problems.
Forms and dosing.  Clonidine is a 
short-acting medication lasting about 
6 hours in children and often requiring 
3 to 4 doses daily for a positive effect. 
Guanfacine is longer acting than clonidine 
and may be given 3 times a day. A 
once-daily form of guanfacine (Intuniv) 
and a twice-daily clonidine (Kapvay) are 
available. Like atomoxetine, it may take a 
few weeks to have the best effect.
Clonidine and guanfacine have also been 
FDA approved to use with stimulant 
medications for ADHD. The combination 
improves symptoms of ADHD alone as 
well as of ADHD plus tics. 
Useful Second-Line 
Nonstimulants
A number of the following medications 
are not FDA approved for the treatment of 
ADHD but have been shown in research 
studies and in clinical practice to be useful 
options if the stimulants or approved 
nonstimulant medications do not work well 
for your child or have too many side effects.
Bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban)  is an 
antidepressant that has been shown to be 
effective for treating ADHD in children and 
adults. Given its use in reducing cigarette 
smoking and improving mood, bupropion 
may be used for adolescents or adults"|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|7|c0a02159df744a428a290907fb2c76ad
"adults. Given its use in reducing cigarette 
smoking and improving mood, bupropion 
may be used for adolescents or adults 
with complex cases of ADHD, including 
patients with substance use or a mood 
disorder. The medication is generic and 
available in immediate-release, sustained-
release (given twice daily), and once-a-
day versions (XL). Side effects include out 
of control behaviors, irritability, insomnia, 
and rarely, seizures.
Modafinil (Provigil, Sparlon), 
and tricyclic antidepressants  are 
medications that are infrequently used 
in ADHD. If your child is using these 
medications, they should be monitored for 
rash (when on modafinil) or have their blood 
levels/electrocardiogram monitored (when 
on tricyclics).Combination treatments.  It is not 
uncommon for a child’s practitioner 
to eventually prescribe a combination 
of medications, such as stimulants 
with alpha agonists like guanfacine or 
clonidine, atomoxetine, or other classes 
of medication. Other than combining 
stimulants and alpha agonists (see Alpha 
agonists  section above), combining 
other medications is not FDA approved 
and there are not many studies on this 
approach to treating ADHD. However, your 
child's prescriber might still recommend 
careful use of more than one medication 
at a time because it may further improve 
ADHD symptoms, treat other mental 
health disorders that your child may have, 
and better manage side effects. For co-
occurring disorders, practitioners typically"|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|7|0e3b55cfa2f24784b950d8c39167dae5

with your practitioner to identify the best 
treatment plan and medication(s) for your 
child. By addressing and treating ADHD,

"16       Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):  Parents’ Medication GuideI have been told that my child 
may have ADHD. What are the 
next steps?
Parents of children who might have ADHD 
should discuss their concerns with their 
child’s primary care practitioner, primary 
teacher, developmental pediatrician, 
and/or mental health specialist, such 
as a child and adolescent psychiatrist 
or psychologist, and seek guidance in 
obtaining a comprehensive evaluation.
Who can treat children and 
adolescents with ADHD?
Children and adolescents with ADHD 
can benefit from careful medication 
management by a child and adolescent 
psychiatrist, pediatrician, child neurologist, 
or advanced practice nurse with 
experience in treating ADHD. Children and 
families may benefit from psychotherapy 
for behavioral, emotional, and academic 
issues, which can be conducted by a 
licensed mental health practitioner.
What do I do if my child doesn’t 
think anything is wrong?
Many children and adolescents with 
ADHD do not think they have a problem 
that requires treatment. Adolescents 
may have some insight into their 
problems but may not believe that 
they need medication. Some children 
or adolescents blame others for their 
problems. For those who deny that they 
have a problem, a frank, non-accusatory 
discussion about the difficulties your 
child is experiencing may help. You may 
also turn to online sources of information

also turn to online sources of information 
such as the CHADD or AACAP websites 
(see Resources  section on page 17).What if my child refuses to 
take medication?
Some children and adolescents can’t explain 
why they refuse to take medication. You 
can explore what they think might happen 
if they take medicine. Some kids fear that 
medication may change their brains, while 
others think that taking medicine means that 
there is something wrong with them, and 
still others may resent taking something that 
may control or change them. For those who 
are taking medication, ask them about any 
side effects (including a belief that they are 
not as social or as much fun to be with) and 
work with the child’s prescriber to minimize 
side effects.
I am afraid of using 
medications for my child.
Many parents would rather not use 
medication to treat their child’s ADHD 
or any other mental health problem. It is 
important to note the problems associated 
with leaving ADHD untreated into adulthood:  
more academic, work-related and social 
problems, as well as higher risks for injuries, 
concussions, depression, suicidality, 
criminality, nicotine and substance use 
disorders compared to those treated for 
their ADHD. It is important to recognize 
that along with educational planning and 
accommodations, medications for children

and adolescents with ADHD are well-studied, 
effective, and safe. There are no unexpected 
long-term side effects of stimulants that 
one does not see in the short term. For 
example, a lowered appetite seen soon 
after beginning stimulants may continue 
longer term. With careful coordination with 
your child’s provider, most side effects 
can be managed with little to no long-term 
problems related to the medication.What if my child with ADHD 
also has motor tics?
About one-third of children with ADHD will 
have spasm-like movements in the face, 
mouth, or upper body. Changes in tics 
may occur naturally, or may be related to 
medication for ADHD (sometimes causes 
increases or decreases in tics). Close 
monitoring of your child for a couple of 
weeks after a change in dose or introduction 
of a new medication is advised.
Are there differences  
between generic and brand 
name medications?
Brand name medications are the types of 
medications that are approved by the FDA 
and have been tested in research. These 
medications are made in a very consistent 
way and are generally preferred by patients 
because they work well and do not have 
serious side effects. Also available at 
pharmacies are generic medications, which 
are similar to brand name medications in 
several important ways. For example, they 
enter the bloodstream almost as much 
as the brand medication (at least 80% as 
much), and are effective, well tolerated,"|data_input/adhd_2/ADHD_Medication_Guide.pdf|9|c6461666b048410c857c45f53d2a74be
"enter the bloodstream almost as much 
as the brand medication (at least 80% as

and less expensive. But, some generic 
medications are not as good as the brand 
name medication that they are copying. This 
has to do with differences in the way that 
the medication is released from the form it 
comes in (for example, a tablet or a capsule 
form) and how much the tablets are affected 
by different conditions such as humidity and 
light, as well as differences in side effects. 
Unfortunately, many pharmacies frequently 
switch among generic products so that 
you may be receiving a different generic

Abstract
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; also known as 
hyperkinetic disorder) is a common neurodevelopmental condition 
that affects children and adults worldwide. ADHD has a predominantly 
genetic aetiology that involves common and rare genetic variants. Some environmental correlates of the disorder have been discovered 
but causation has been difficult to establish. The heterogeneity of 
the condition is evident in the diverse presentation of symptoms and 
levels of impairment, the numerous co-occurring mental and physical 
conditions, the various domains of neurocognitive impairment, and extensive minor structural and functional brain differences. The 
diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard 
diagnostic criteria. Curative treatments for ADHD do not exist but evidence-based treatments substantially reduce symptoms and/or"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|0|3f75399f2eb34351b1b002d5779017fe
"diagnostic criteria. Curative treatments for ADHD do not exist but evidence-based treatments substantially reduce symptoms and/or 
functional impairment. Medications are effective for core symptoms 
and are usually well tolerated. Some non-pharmacological treatments are valuable, especially for improving adaptive functioning. Clinical and 
neurobiological research is ongoing and could lead to the creation of 
personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder.Sections

remission is common, and can occur even in those in full remission13– 17. 
Typically, severe ADHD has an earlier onset18 and a less fluctuating 
course through adulthood than milder ADHD13.
In youth, the male-to-female sex ratio of ADHD is 2.4:1 in the gen-
eral population5. However, the ratio is much higher (4:1) in those seek -
ing treatment19 because boys are more disruptive than girls, which 
makes boys more likely to be referred20,21. The sex ratio drops to 2:1 in 
adolescents22, and, in adults, ranges from 1.9:1 to 1.2:1 in registry and 
claims data23–26 and 1.1:1 in population surveys27. The shifting ratios 
throughout the lifespan is attributed to several factors, such as later 
recognition of ADHD in females than in males, an increase in women 
seeking help in adulthood, and a decreased emphasis on hyperactivity 
in adult ADHD diagnoses, which aligns more closely with the presenta -
tion of ADHD in females28–30. In addition, parent referral for treatment 
in childhood is replaced by self-referral in adulthood, and women 
are more likely to seek professional help for mental health problems 
than men31.
Little is known about ADHD in racial and ethnic minority popula-
tions, although health-care disparities have been documented32,33.

"tions, although health-care disparities have been documented32,33. 
Population studies suggest that ADHD is under-diagnosed in Black 
and Latin minority youth34–39, even among children with many ADHD 
symptoms34. In Europe, ADHD is less likely to be diagnosed among 
immigrants than among non-immigrants33. The reasons for these dif-
ferences are differences in access to care, or cultural factors that affect 
the diagnostic process. For example, in white-majority countries, Black 
patients with ADHD are significantly less likely to receive pharmaco -
logical treatment than white patients40. However, the diagnosis of 
ADHD in individuals of certain ethnicities may be improving41.
ADHD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders42,43. The 
presence of these comorbid conditions is associated with higher 
ADHD symptom severity and poorer outcomes, including premature 
death44– 47. Up to 70–80% of individuals with ADHD are estimated to 
have at least one comorbid mental condition across the lifespan48. In 
childhood, meta-analyses of general population studies have yielded 
pooled odds ratios of 10.7 (95% CI 7.7–14.8) for conduct disorder, 5.5 
(95% CI 3.5–8.4) for major depressive disorder, and 3.0 (95% CI 2.1–4.3)

comorbidity of ADHD50,51. In adulthood, meta-analyses based on find-

for major depressive disorder, 8.7 (95% CI 5.5–13.9) for bipolar disorder 
and 4.6 (95% CI 2.7–7.8) for substance use disorder43.
ADHD is also often comorbid with somatic conditions52,53. Meta-
analyses have found in children and adolescents pooled odds ratios of 
1.4 (95% CI 1.3–1.5) for dermatitis, 1.3 (95% CI 1.2–1.5) for obesity, 1.6 (95% 
CI 1.2–2.1) for asthma and 1.6 (95% CI 1.3–1.9) for rhinitis54, and in adults 
a pooled odds ratio of 2.3 (95% CI 1.5–3.6) for type 2 diabetes mellitus55. 
Moreover, a nationwide population-based study in adults found hazard 
ratios of 2.05 (95% CI 1.98–2.13) for onset of any cardiovascular disease56. 
ADHD is also associated with vision problems, but not with structural 
alterations of the eye57. Children with ADHD have many sleep difficulties, 
including bedtime resistance, late sleep onset, night awakenings, morning  
awakenings, sleep disordered breathing and daytime sleepiness58.

"Meta-analyses of twin studies and family studies have shown that the heritability of ADHD is ~80%
59–61, meaning that genetic factors Introduction
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condi-tion characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. The 
first known description of the syndrome is from Hippocrates in 493 B.C. 
and the first description in medical textbooks by German and Scottish 
physicians is from the end of the eighteenth century (see ref. 1  and 
Supplementary Fig. 1). ADHD is often a seriously impairing and pre -
dominantly persistent condition. The disorder is primarily influenced 
by genetic factors, but environmental factors also have a role, many of 
which remain unknown. Moreover, from many large, well-designed, epi -
demiological, clinical and longitudinal studies, we know the disorder’s 
core symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity), impair -
ments (for example, school and occupational failure, poor socializa -
tion, and accidental injuries) and comorbidities (for example, anxiety 
and mood disorders).
The diagnosis of ADHD requires a clinical interview that queries 
about the core symptoms and associated impairments following the 
guidelines of either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the Ameri -
can Psychiatric Association 5th edition (DSM-5)2 or the International 
Classification of Diseases 11th edition (ICD-11)3. The evaluation of"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|1|8675bf47cddf415c849be40d78373008
"can Psychiatric Association 5th edition (DSM-5)2 or the International 
Classification of Diseases 11th edition (ICD-11)3. The evaluation of 
patients can be assisted with reliable and valid measurement tools 
for screening, diagnosis and monitoring treatment outcomes. Many 
rigorous clinical trials have documented the safety and efficacy of 
many ADHD treatments. We know which ADHD treatments work (and 
for which outcomes), which do not3, and which require further study4.
This Primer provides an overview of the epidemiology, mecha -
nisms, diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. In the past 5 years, we have 
learned much about the aetiology of this disorder from breakthroughs 
in genetics. That work, along with further imaging studies, provides 
hints about mechanisms of disease onset. We know much more about 
clinical features and the course over the lifespan, emotional dysregula -
tion, the association of ADHD with somatic disorders, variation in age 
at onset and fluctuations in severity. In addition, more management 
options are available due to the development of new pharmacological 
and non-pharmacological treatments.
Epidemiology
In school-aged children, the prevalence of ADHD based on epidemio -
logical samples representative of the general population is 5.3% and 
does not differ markedly by geographical region5,6. In some individu-
als, symptom severity declines during adolescence7 but two-thirds of 
children with ADHD retain impairing symptoms in adulthood at clinical"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|1|e8f281196837476b8cb072d000780335
"als, symptom severity declines during adolescence7 but two-thirds of 
children with ADHD retain impairing symptoms in adulthood at clinical 
or subthreshold levels8. In early adulthood, the prevalence of ADHD 
is ~2.5%9,10 with a gradual decrease to 1% at older ages10,11 (Fig. 1; onset 
in childhood required). Diagnosis is often delayed. Children who are 
primarily inattentive do not disrupt the classroom or aggravate par -
ents and are typically referred later to treatment, which leads to lower 
rates of referral of girls who are typically more inattentive than boys. 
Referral for treatment is also delayed for children whose environments 
protect them with social, emotional and intellectual scaffolding. Due to 
diagnostic delays, the peak age at diagnosis is 9.5 years, with a median 
of 12 years. Only 56.8% of individuals with ADHD are diagnosed before 
14 years of age; 73.0% are diagnosed by 18 years and 91.8% by 25 years12.
ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, and symptoms vary among 
individuals. In addition to this variability, the course of symptoms and 
impairment in ADHD fluctuate over time within individual patients13–16. 
ADHD symptoms and impairments tend to worsen under certain condi -
tions, that include increased self-regulation challenges, weak support 
systems, intensification of comorbid conditions and poor fit between"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|1|c20d262d54484a21aab8aeae8cf1fc2f

0123456789();: Primercontribute strongly to the development of ADHD. Heritability of ADHD 
is similar across sexes60, childhood and adulthood62, and symptom 
domains (inattentive or hyperactive–impulsive)63. Twin and family 
studies have found that the same genetic factors influence both the 
disorder of ADHD and lower levels of ADHD symptoms in the general 
population61,64, and that shared genetic factors partly explain the 
co-occurrence of ADHD with other psychiatric disorders (including 
anxiety, major depressive, bipolar, conduct, autism spectrum and 
substance use disorders)59,65–69 and some somatic conditions70. Twin 
studies also found that ADHD is genetically associated with measures 
of cognition, electroencephalographic (EEG) variability and subtle 
structural brain differences65,66.
Molecular genetic studies of ADHD have largely corroborated 
findings from twin studies and family studies65 and support a polygenic 
contribution to ADHD risk, with heritability from common genetic 
variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) estimated at 
14–20%59,71, and evidence of high (>0.80) common variant genetic 
correlations across sexes72, and across children diagnosed with ADHD 
and adults diagnosed with ADHD73,74. Genetic correlations estimated 
from SNPs have also suggested a strong genetic link between clini -
cally diagnosed ADHD and ADHD symptoms in the population, and"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|2|4df27c1dd878438eadab85dab875562c
"from SNPs have also suggested a strong genetic link between clini -
cally diagnosed ADHD and ADHD symptoms in the population, and 
broadly between ADHD genetic liability and many mental and somatic 
conditions, and other traits71,75–80 (Fig.  2). Among these, educational 
attainment has one of the strongest associations, with higher ADHD 
polygenic scores linked to worse cognitive performance and educa -
tional outcomes71,76,81,82. Genetic variants implicated in ADHD have also 
been linked to smaller intracranial brain volume83 and to the functional 
connectivity of subcortical brain regions84.
The largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADHD 
found 27 genome-wide significant loci implicating 76 genes, many of 
which are upregulated during early brain development. ADHD genetic 
risk is enriched for genes associated with several brain-specific neuronal 
subtypes and midbrain dopaminergic neurons71. Notable implicated 
genes include FOXP1 and FOXP2, in which rare variants are linked to 
speech disorders and intellectual disability, and SORCS3, PTPRF and 
MEF2C, which are involved in the formation of synaptic connections 
and encode integral components of the postsynaptic density mem -
brane, implicating synaptic development and density in the pathology 
of ADHD.
Studies of rare genetic variants also found an increased burden of 
rare protein-truncating variants in evolutionarily constrained genes"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|2|63522617a5594e0185a48ca161e80b22
"of ADHD.
Studies of rare genetic variants also found an increased burden of 
rare protein-truncating variants in evolutionarily constrained genes 
in ADHD71,85, and showed replicated associations with several copy number variants (CNVs), many of which are also implicated in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia
86–88 (Box  1).
Studies of common and rare variants (Fig.  3) converge on the 
conclusion that many ADHD risk loci implicate neurodevelopmental 
processes, which is consistent with the idea of a link between ADHD and 
alterations in brain development, structure and function. However, 
a major limitation is that the majority of genetic studies of ADHD are largely based on samples of European ancestry
60,71.
Progress in understanding the genetic basis of ADHD has gener-
ated hope that these findings may be used for patient stratification 
and prediction of disease and treatment outcomes. However, the 
current polygenic score for ADHD is not sufficiently precise for use 
in diagnosis75. Likewise, polygenic scores or single genetic variants 
are not useful for choosing medications, despite some data showing 
significant effects of genetic variants on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of medications used to treat ADHD89,90.
Environmental correlates

are not confounded by third variables. By contrast, in most cases, envi -"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|2|53749172127e40f6b152653b350c1f96
"Because genetic variation is fixed before the onset of ADHD, its effects 
are not confounded by third variables. By contrast, in most cases, envi -
ronmental causes of ADHD are more difficult to measure and their asso -
ciations with ADHD may reflect an unmeasured third variable. Although 
there is strong evidence that rare events (for example, traumatic brain 
injury91,92 and extreme emotional and nutritional deprivation early in 
life93) can cause ADHD, many other environmental events are associ -
ated with ADHD94. Most are events or complications occurring during 
pregnancy, delivery or early after birth (for example, low birthweight, 
perinatal hypoxia and advanced paternal age), although all have low 
risk ratios for ADHD. Low risk ratios are difficult to interpret because low levels of risk could be due to confounding
95,96.
Socioeconomic status (SES) is a good example of the difficulties 
interpreting environmental correlates of ADHD. Children in families of  
low SES are twice as likely to have ADHD than their peers in families 
of high SES97, and people with ADHD can have low educational and 
occupational under-attainment4. Studies have evaluated whether low 
SES causes ADHD or whether ADHD causes families to have a lower SES, 
and have found support for both mechanisms98, although twin stud-
ies suggest that the environmental correlates of ADHD are mostly 
individual-specific rather than, like SES, shared within families60,99."|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|2|457127a2916246ea9aec4d150d934c3f

due to both direct genetic parent-to-offspring transmission and the 
effects of a low SES environment on the mental health of offspring101 ,102.
Other studies have linked the polygenic liability for ADHD to 
negative health behaviours and psychosocial impairment75–77,103 –106. 
Thus, some environmental correlates of ADHD may, in part, reflect 
the genetic risk for ADHD. When studies have adjusted for familial 
confounders, which include genetics, some apparent environmental 
correlates have attenuated or disappeared107 ,108. A good example of this 
effect is maternal smoking during pregnancy. Many epidemiological 
studies and meta-analyses of these studies109 –111 have concluded that 
maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with ADHD. How -
ever, a meta-analysis of sibling-control studies found no association 
between ADHD and maternal smoking112. This meta-analysis also found 
that the mother’s polygenic risk for ADHD significantly predicted 
whether she smoked during pregnancy. These data confirmed the 
findings of another study113 showing that maternal smoking during 
pregnancy does not predict ADHD in offspring if the oocyte leading 
to pregnancy was donated.

"Very little is known about which factors promote resilience in those 
susceptible to ADHD, although social, intellectual and emotional ‘scaf -
folding’ have been suggested to delay the onset of the disorder114. 
Scaffolding occurs when a compensating resource prevents the emer -
gence of symptoms. Implicated mechanisms are social acceptance, 
positive parenting and self-perceptions of competence115.
Electrophysiology and brain imaging
ADHD has a multifactorial aetiology and is clinically heterogeneous, 
suggesting that multiple pathophysiological pathways are involved 
in the development of this disorder (Fig.  4). Neurophysiology and 
neuroimaging studies have provided some clues to the pathophysiology.Electrophysiology studies found a higher theta to beta ratio (which 
is related to inattention) and differences in event-related potentials 
(ERPs) of higher-order cognitive processing stages in people with 
ADHD compared with those without ADHD116 ,117. However, these find-
ings are substantially heterogeneous, with only evidence of the theta to 
beta ratio in those with high levels of both inattentive and hyperactive–  
impulsive symptoms, and larger effect sizes for ERP differences in 
younger and non-medicated individuals with ADHD118.
In terms of structural brain alterations, MRI mega-analyses have 
found small to moderate structural brain differences in children but 
not adolescents or adults with ADHD compared with controls. Affected"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|3|d2352bb874834f6598ecc9e784549173
"found small to moderate structural brain differences in children but 
not adolescents or adults with ADHD compared with controls. Affected 
regions include a smaller total cortical surface area in late developing 
cortical association areas important for executive functions (such as the frontal, cingulate, parietal and temporal regions) and reductions in cortical thickness in areas important for emotion processing (such as the fusiform gyrus and temporal pole)
119. In addition, studies have 
demonstrated smaller intracranial, basal ganglia and limbic volumes120. 
Moreover, the smaller cortical surface area and ventromedial orbito -
frontal cortical thickness have also been shown to be associated with 
ADHD traits in population studies121 and have been observed in siblings 
of people with ADHD119, suggesting that they may reflect an under -
lying genetic vulnerability to ADHD122 –124. Analyses of white matter 
tracts have most consistently shown smaller fractional anisotropy 
in tracts mediating visual attention, including the posterior corpus 
callosum connecting temporo-parieto-occipital regions and the sagit -
tal striatum, which also connects to subcortical regions119,125. The most 
recent mega-analysis included five cohorts with almost 7,000 partici -
pants, and found reduced fractional anisotropy in inferior longitudinal 
and left uncinate fasciculi126.

right or bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during atten -
tion and working memory tasks, respectively127 ,131. Regarding functional 
connectivity, attentional lapses in ADHD have been suggested to be 
due to inappropriate interference of the default mode network (DMN), 
that is involved in self-referential thoughts and mind-wandering, in the 
activity of networks involved in attention and cognitive control132. Two 
meta-analyses have provided evidence supporting this DMN interfer-
ence hypothesis. These meta-analyses included resting-state fMRI 
studies restricted to a priori-specified brain regions133 ,134, and found 
dysfunctional intrinsic connectivity involving the DMN and atten -
tion and cognitive control networks. Moreover, a large mega-analysis 
including 1,301 subjects with ADHD and 1,301 controls found decreased 
anticorrelation between the DMN and dorsal and ventral attention and

studies on multiple intrinsic connectivity metrics.

delay in children with ADHD, finding a delay in cortical thickness and 
surface area development, especially in frontal and temporal regions,

in functional brain maturation in resting-state DMN, and cognitive 
control and ventral attention networks and in the anti-correlation 
between the DMN and these networks140, with reduced connectivity 
with the right inferior prefrontal cortex associated with worse inat -
tention later in life141. Collectively, these findings support the view 
that ADHD is due to immature brain structure and atypical functional  
development.

PTPRF has, along with other attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-associated genes (MEF2C, FOXP2 and CHRNA7),

mutations in MEF2C may lead to imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, which may contribute to risk of several psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, ASD, intellectual disorder and schizophrenia

DUSP6 is thought to alter neurotransmitter homeostasis by affecting dopamine levels in synapses, which is likley to be of biological relevance to ADHD. DUSP6 has also been associated with BMI, educational attainment, insomnia and smoking initiation in GWAS.
Genes identified through CNV analyses
CNV associationsCNVs in the 1q21.1, 6q26, 15q11–13, 16p11.2, 17q12 and 22q11.21 regions show well-replicated associations with ADHD. Most have also been implicated in ASD, schizophrenia and intellectual disabilities, or genetic syndromes
86–88. Some CNVs implicate genes with potentially 
relevant biological function for ADHD. For example, POLR3C and PRKN are involved in dopamine regulation
86; CNVs in the 15q11–13 
region implicate genes involved in nicotinic signalling (for example, CHRNA7, which may be linked to ADHD through modulation of dopaminergic neurons).

ing symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity–impulsivity in children

6 months and have an onset before the age of 12 years. Initial diagnosis 
of ADHD in adults is possible if some impairing symptoms emerged 
before the age of 12 years. For diagnosis in both adults and children, 
symptoms must cause clinically meaningful impairment and not be 
better explained by another condition2. Symptoms must also be more 
severe than expected given the child’s developmental level. Although 
not part of the core symptoms, deficient emotional self-regulation is 
common in ADHD and causes clinically meaningful impairments151.

inferior frontal cortex is important for inhibition, timing and sustained attention, and the parietal cortex for attention and cognitive flexibility. b , ADHD also 
involves subcortical structures of the brain. The ventral and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex mediate the affective and cognitive components of executive control, respectively. Together with the frontal lobes, the basal ganglia (that is, the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus and putamen) and the thalamus, 
they form the frontostriatal circuits. Frontocerebellar circuits have also been 
implicated in ADHD, in particular in the context of timing and motor control. Other subcortical regions involved are the amygdala and hippocampus, which mediate emotion and reward processing. c , Several neurotransmitter circuits 
are also involved in ADHD. The dopaminergic system plays an important part in the regulation of movement, mood regulation, attention, learning and memory, novelty and reward processing. The noradrenergic system is important for 
attention and arousal, signal-to-noise processing, mood regulation and stress 
response. Both neurotransmitters interact but also have independent effects. d, Networks that mediate executive functions are implicated in ADHD. The"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|6|a467cfbc6f40495685b705827d16d2a4

view to assess psychiatric comorbidity. Administering these rating 
scales on a yearly basis can discover emerging problems.
Of note, diagnostic criteria for ADHD in ICD-11 differ slightly from 
those in DSM-5-TR, as ICD-11 omits numbered symptom lists and instead 
requires several meaningful symptoms from one of three clusters 
(inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity). Criteria in ICD-11 also 
consider intellectual functioning and environmental demands when 
judging whether symptoms and impairment are outside normal limits3. 
Both systems highlight that symptoms may be less evident when the 
individual is engaged in activities that provide intense stimulation or frequent rewards.
Diagnosis of ADHD must be based on an interview of the parent 
and/or patient. No biological measure of ADHD shows sufficient sen-
sitivity and specificity to serve as a standalone diagnostic test90,152. 
When used alongside a clinical assessment, some tests can stream -
line the assessment process and shorten the time to diagnosis153 ,154. 
Measures of neurocognitive functioning can assist with treatment 
planning and assist measurement-based care155. Symptom checklists 
are useful for screening but lead to many false-positive diagnoses when 
used alone156 because they do not assess impairment, age at onset and"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|7|f7be6afb231d48f084222a0d070bf126
"are useful for screening but lead to many false-positive diagnoses when 
used alone156 because they do not assess impairment, age at onset and 
pervasiveness156 ,157. Accordingly, these checklists should never be used 
as standalone tools for diagnosis of ADHD158.
Assessment of children and adolescents
Parent-administered structured or semi-structured interviews are 
cornerstone diagnostic tools for ADHD159. These interviews deter -
mine symptom and impairment severity with questions about the 
settings in which symptoms occur, onset, duration, and any periods 
of remission, as well as comorbid disorders that may mimic ADHD. 
Broadband psychopathology and narrowband ADHD symptom or 
impairment scales supplement, but do not replace interviews158. These 
scales are quick and cost-effective, and permit gathering data from 
teachers and other care-givers. They are useful for assessing treat -
ment response and fluctuations over time. Narrowband scales assess 
the severity of ADHD, whereas broadband scales provide valuable 
information about the presence and severity of comorbidity and 
signal which additional assessments might be fruitful. A compre -
hensive list of free ADHD assessment tools is provided in Supple-
mentary Box 1. Several rating scales are also available for a fee; these 
scales cover the same symptom domains but have the added value of 
normative data.

"scales cover the same symptom domains but have the added value of 
normative data.
Assessment modifications for children who have not yet entered 
elementary school include structured behavioural observations 
(clinic-based or classroom-based) and more emphasis on teacher rat-
ings than ratings from other individuals. Other individuals may strug -
gle to perceive inattentive symptoms or differentiate normative and 
non-normative hyperactivity or impulsivity in pre-elementary school 
children1, whereas preschool teachers and clinicians are typically bet -
ter than parents at differentiating normative versus non-normative 
behaviours owing to their interaction with many young children.
Modifications for adolescents include using self-reports, which 
promotes rapport and improves the detection of symptoms and impair -
ments unknown to their parents. Speaking with the affected individual 
often yields information about the individual’s self-awareness and 
motivation for treatment. However, as adolescents with ADHD often struggle with self-awareness, parent and teacher reports remain cen-
tral to diagnosis160. Obtaining a report from every secondary school 
teacher is not necessary and, if feasible, the class where the student struggles most is a useful starting point for assessment. Clinicians can 
also obtain additional teacher ratings to better understand variability 
in the adolescent’s symptoms across settings161. Comorbidities such as"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|7|aa1f84e1dcea415583b38af0fc5fd5b2
"also obtain additional teacher ratings to better understand variability 
in the adolescent’s symptoms across settings161. Comorbidities such as 
depression, anxiety and substance use commonly first appear during adolescence, necessitating thorough screening and assessment
162.
Assessment of adults
Because adults with persistent childhood ADHD tend to not recognize 
their past and current symptoms of ADHD163 ,164, they are more likely 
to seek help for a new-onset disorder that commonly co-occurs with 
ADHD such as substance use, mood, anxiety, sleep or co-occurring 
somatic disorders. Screening patients with these disorders for ADHD 
is useful, particularly in those not responding to standard therapies 
for the comorbid condition. Treating ADHD in these patients often 
improves management of the comorbidity165 ,166. Some rating scales 
are available for screening for ADHD in adults (see Supplementary 
Box 1). The sensitivity of diagnosing ADHD in adults is improved when 
spouses, parents or close friends supply information29.
Although some studies have suggested that the onset of ADHD in 
adulthood is common, limitations of these studies114 and subsequent 
research157 indicate that, although ADHD is often first identified late 
in life, its onset is mostly in childhood or adolescence. As mentioned 
above, the onset of ADHD often precedes its identification by many 
years29,167. Many patients with ADHD detected in adulthood were pro -"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|7|463c409e0d2543a8bf235691867def09
"above, the onset of ADHD often precedes its identification by many 
years29,167. Many patients with ADHD detected in adulthood were pro -
tected from an earlier onset of ADHD by high intelligence, supportive 
parents or other protective scaffolding168. Although DSM and ICD 
criteria permit diagnosis of apparent adult-onset ADHD, it should be made cautiously
169.
When a patient’s status supports a clear diagnosis of ADHD but 
onset prior to the age 12 years cannot be documented, alternative 
explanations should be considered, such as emergent health condi -
tions or normal cognitive or behavioural fluctuations (for example, 
stress-related strains on cognition, effects of ageing or menopause). 
Of note, some patients, especially young adults, will fake ADHD symp -
toms in the hope of acquiring a stimulant prescription for diversion 
or abuse170. Individuals with a history of substance abuse or antisocial 
behaviour are at greatest risk. Online health misinformation about 
ADHD is increasing171, and some adults may confuse ADHD with another 
disorder or misinterpret normal cognitive fluctuations. The misinfor -
mation circulated via social media worsens this problem171. Accord -
ingly, clinicians might consider asking adults who self-refer to share 
how they came to believe they have ADHD. Documenting that symp -
toms of ADHD cause impairment is even more essential when ADHD is

Diagnostic challenges
Supplementary Table 1 lists common diagnostic challenges and reco -
mmendations for ADHD. After standard information gathering, tai -
lored assessment must refine details of the presentation, particularly in 
complex cases (for example, individuals with multiple comorbidities, 
mitigating psychosocial factors such as supportive family members or 
low academic demands that may mask impairment). Assessing simplex 
ADHD is relatively straightforward and efficient, whereas complex cases 
require careful attention because mental comorbidity is common, 
and some symptoms of ADHD are present in other disorders. Referral to a clinician specializing in ADHD may be called for to ensure proper assessment of a complex case."|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|7|6b223bf0b26443c1a5aff867c4d2a6e6

Pharmacological treatments
In most clinical guidelines (for example, those of the National Insti -
tute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE))173 pharmacotherapy is 
considered the first-line treatment for ADHD (after implementation 
of environmental modifications), although the American Academy of  
Pediatrics174 recommends using pharmacotherapy in combination 
with behavioural therapy. Behavioural therapy could be tried first in 
preschool children, but medication175 may be needed if behavioural 
therapy is unsuccessful or in those with severe ADHD176 (Fig.  5).
Medications approved for use in ADHD by the FDA and other regu -
latory agencies are stimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamine 
formulations) and non-stimulants. Non-stimulants comprise noradren -
aline reuptake inhibitors (atomoxetine, viloxazine extended release 
(ER)) and ɑ2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine ER and guanfacine ER) 
(Table  1). Some medications in each stimulant class are approved for 
use in both children and adults. Atomoxetine and viloxazine ER are 
approved for use in children and adults. Clonidine ER and guanfacine 
ER are approved in the USA for use in children only, even though studies 
support the efficacy of guanfacine ER in adults177 ,178. Randomized con -

tions in reducing symptoms of ADHD143,179 ,180. Outside North America,"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|8|51c8ac204f0f4a2b8ff1b298454967aa
"trolled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy of these medica-
tions in reducing symptoms of ADHD143,179 ,180. Outside North America, 
methylphenidate is often the only licensed stimulant medication for the treatment of ADHD.
Clinical guidelines recommend stimulants as the first-choice medi -
cation for ADHD owing to their high efficacy. The NICE guidelines spec -
ify that methylphenidate should be tried first in youths, followed by 
lisdexamfetamine or other amphetamines, and then non-stimulants173. 
Amphetamines or methylphenidate can be considered as first-line 
in adults, followed by non-stimulants173. These recommendations 
are consistent with results from a network meta-analysis179 of RCTs of ADHD medications. Other guidelines159 do not prioritize between 
methylphenidate and amphetamine, which are both highly effective in 
youths. Importantly, clinical recommendations and meta-analyses 
refer to the group level; at the individual level, many patients respond 
equally well to methylphenidate and to amphetamines, whereas oth-
ers have a more selective response or tolerability to one of the two 
stimulant classes.
Some patients have an excellent response to non-stimulant 
monotherapy143, whereas others are optimally treated with com -
binations of stimulants and non-stimulants, or combinations of 
longer-acting and shorter-acting stimulants. Managing the duration

"longer-acting and shorter-acting stimulants. Managing the duration 
of response to the different medications is often a focus of clinical 
treatment. Response to medication should be assessed in relation to the 
pharmacokinetics and duration of action of the selected formulation. 
Symptoms and level of function are best addressed when the blood 
levels are adequate relative to the time of greatest need and the spe -
cific tasks to be addressed. However, there is significant individual 
variability in pharmacokinetic characteristics and duration of action of 
specific formulations. The duration of action of non-stimulants may be 
longer than that of stimulants because the long-acting ɑ2 agonists and 
selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors have long half-lives181 ,182. 
The ɑ2 agonists can be dosed once daily; atomoxetine has a relatively 
short half-life in the large majority of patients and is approved for 
both once-daily and twice-daily administration. Moreover, although 
clinical guidelines recommend starting pharmacological therapy with 
stimulants, starting with a non-stimulant could be considered in some 
patients, including those with comorbid anxiety, tics, sleep problems, 
mood dysregulation or substance abuse. However, of note, none of 
these conditions are exclusionary for the use of stimulants, and data 
indicate that stimulants can be used effectively in the presence of these

zine may not be evident before 6–8 weeks of use, but good responders 
show substantial improvement after 2–4 weeks184– 186. Titration to 
the maximum tolerated dose is often recommended to maximize 
treatment efficacy.
Managing stimulant-refractory ADHD requires an assessment 
of the reasons underlying non-response (Box  2). Although several 
guidelines recommend using doses beyond the maximum approved 
doses, such doses should be considered in selected cases only (for 
example, individuals who have a partial response to and tolerate the 
maximum dose). Before titrating stimulants above the upper recom-
mended dose threshold, clinicians could consider switching to the 
other stimulant class, which may make it possible to use a dose within 
guidelines. However, our understanding of the best maximum dose, 
and of the relationship between dose and blood level, brain level or 
drug metabolism is limited.
The most common adverse events are appetite reduction, delayed 
sleep onset (stimulants) and other sleep issues (non-stimulants), 
although patients can also experience improvement in sleep owing"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|9|c7893a96de66489ba4d5d550e45055ee
"sleep onset (stimulants) and other sleep issues (non-stimulants), 
although patients can also experience improvement in sleep owing 
to decreased hyperactivity in the evening. Insomnia generally can 
be managed and does not require stopping an effective ADHD treat-
ment. Headaches and stomach aches are also common adverse effects. 
Some individuals experience dysphoria and irritability, though 
irritability often improves with treatment. Moreover, when initiat -
ing treatment, a slight increase in heart rate and blood pressure is 
common, although it is not clinically significant in most patients. 
With long-term treatment at higher doses, there is a small but signi-
ficant risk of hypertension and arterial disease in adults187, but more 
studies are needed188. Data from meta-analyses suggest that, at the 
group level, stimulants are not significantly associated with the onset 
or worsening of tics189; however, this may not be the case in some  
individuals.
There are no guidelines as to how long a treatment should be 
continued and how or when it should be stopped in individuals with 
ADHD. Although discontinuation trials support the persistence of 
beneficial effects beyond the first 2 years of treatment, reassessing the 
effectiveness of treatment at least once each year is recommended190. 
Whether it is possible or even desirable to pause stimulant use at 
weekends is debated173. Against this recommendation is that ADHD"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|9|b3d11fd84fc943208099be13916d9f51
"Whether it is possible or even desirable to pause stimulant use at 
weekends is debated173. Against this recommendation is that ADHD 
occurs in multiple settings (not just in school) and causes impair -
ments in family and social function that can equally occur on week -
ends and on weekdays. Moreover, some academic activity is often 
required on weekends. In favour of pausing stimulants on weekends 
is that, in some patients, academic function is the primary focus of 
treatment, and tolerability may be an issue. Frequently occurring 
adverse events that may necessitate weekend pauses in treatment are 
decreased appetite and sleep problems. Others advise medication-free 
weekends and/or pauses in treatment at various times during the year 
to address concerns about growth delays, which are typically small  
and reversible191 ,192.
No specific guidelines are available on the use of ADHD medica-
tions in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Accordingly, the choice 
of continuing treatment in this population should be discussed on 
a case-by-case basis. However, of note, there is no evidence suggest -
ing that the use of ADHD medication during pregnancy results in 
significant adverse consequences for mother or offspring193 ,194.Table 1 | Medications approved by the FDA for the treatment

0123456789();: PrimerNon-pharmacological treatments
Management of patients with ADHD should be comprehensive and 
holistic, including psychoeducation for the patient and the patient’s 
family. Treatment should consider the severity of ADHD, comorbid con -
ditions, resources and environmental factors. Non-pharmacological 
treatments address symptoms of ADHD that do not respond to medi-
cation and other impairments (for example, defiance, disruptive 
behaviour and low self-esteem)195 ,196. They are also used in those with 
contraindications or preferences against medication (Fig.  6). However, 
non-pharmacological treatments are usually not first-line for ADHD 
due to their lower efficacy compared with stimulants (Fig.  7). In some 
patients, assessment of neurocognitive functions may detect cognitive 
strengths and weaknesses that are helpful for planning educational or 
vocational strategies.
Psychosocial interventions in children and adolescents.  Behav -
ioural therapy and cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) delivered in 
clinics or schools are the primary psychosocial treatments for children 
with ADHD. These therapies are typically multicomponent, engage 
parents and modify behaviours based on social learning principles 
and cognitive–behavioural strategies (organization skills, problem 
solving, metacognitive strategies and social skills)197. These therapies"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|10|360afef79dca46698f2d26353ed72c40
"and cognitive–behavioural strategies (organization skills, problem 
solving, metacognitive strategies and social skills)197. These therapies 
seek to temper the effect of ADHD on the individual’s daily life by modi -
fying environmental factors (for example, parenting and educational 
context) and psychological factors (for example, psychological beliefs 
and coping mechanisms). Young children may not be direct recipients 
of treatment; however, behavioural therapy collaboratively engages 
adolescents and parents, incorporating engagement strategies such 
as motivational interviewing198 ,199. Motivational interviewing provides 
clinicians with a toolbox of technical and relational communication 
strategies that increase the patient’s interest in behavioural change.
An individual participant mega-analysis showed small to medium 
sized improvements in ADHD symptoms with behavioural therapies, 
with manipulation of antecedents of behaviour and reinforcement 
techniques being effective components200 ,201. Furthermore, dozens 
of well-designed RCTs have established the substantial efficacy of 
behavioural therapy in reducing disruptive behaviours and improving 
the impairments in children, and improving parenting skills of their 
parents197. Compared with medication, behavioural therapy puts higher 
demands on parents, patients and clinicians. Moreover, behavioural 
therapy takes longer to show initial efficacy than pharmaco logical ther -"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|10|33c97251e30145f2bd6398342f90355f
"demands on parents, patients and clinicians. Moreover, behavioural 
therapy takes longer to show initial efficacy than pharmaco logical ther -
apy, because many weeks of therapy are needed. Behavioural therapy 
is well-liked by patients and consistently shows maintenance effects 
for months and sometimes years after treatment, particularly in 
adolescents197. However, behavioural therapy may not be appropriate in 
those who require immediate symptom relief or if no adult is positioned 
to consistently participate in the treatment. The effects of behavioural 
therapy on comorbidity show mixed results with both positive and 
null effects reported for externalizing comorbidities, internalizing 
comorbidities and emotional dysregulation. The effect on comorbidi -
ties probably depends on the specific focus of the behavioural therapy 
and the underlying comorbidity197.
Psychosocial interventions in adults.  In adults with ADHD, CBT in 
individual or group settings as well as skills training have the greatest 
evidence for efficacy202. CBT aims to change dysfunctional thoughts 
and behaviours203 ,204. Skills training addresses problem solving, distrac -
tion delay techniques, time management, behavioural control instruc -
tions, emotion regulation, mindfulness and social communication. The available evidence is most robust for CBT195; other psychosocial 
interventions have insufficient evidence for a clear recommendation"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|10|166c5cc097ad401692cdae6340f82ff5
"interventions have insufficient evidence for a clear recommendation 
for their use in adults205. Data from RCTs show that combined treat -
ment with medication and CBT is superior to medication alone for 
ADHD symptoms206. CBT alone also improves anxiety, depression, 
self-esteem207 and emotional regulation208. Behavioural therapies can 
have long-lasting effects in adults206 ,209. Indeed, participants and their 
significant others rate these interventions as very helpful210 ,211. However, 
multicentre RCTs have shown that CBT does not reduce core ADHD 
symptoms to the same extent as first-line stimulant medication212, 
particularly in studies using appropriate control groups213– 215.
Nutrition and exercise.  ADHD is associated with unhealthy diets, 
with high intake of ultra-processed foods with high proportions of 
refined sugar and saturated fat216 ,217, and nutritional deficiencies, such 
as of vitamins B2 and B6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids218. Impor -
tantly, however, these findings are observational rather than causal, 
because ADHD symptoms and the genetic risk of ADHD may influ -
ence dietary choices219. Three types of dietary interventions for ADHD 
have been studied: supplements, exclusions and complex dietary 
approaches. Significant although small to moderate reductions in 
ADHD symptoms based on properly blinded and controlled RCTs have 
been reported for ω3 fatty acid supplements195 ,220, broad-spectrum"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|10|338cb83340684e32afa883746d20380e
"ADHD symptoms based on properly blinded and controlled RCTs have 
been reported for ω3 fatty acid supplements195 ,220, broad-spectrum 
micronutrient supplements221, and exclusion of food colour addi -
tives and preservatives195. The effects of diets limited to only a few 
hypo-allergenic foods vary widely, depending on sample selection and 
study design195 ,222. Complex interventions with healthy diets, a Medi-
terranean diet and the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension offer 
promise but await rigorous testing223– 225. Similarly, physical exercise 
may briefly relieve ADHD symptoms but has limited efficacy205.Box 2
Management of stimulant-  
refractory ADHD298
Prior to changing to non-stimulants or adding medications consider 
the following:
 •Has the dose been titrated correctly to the maximum tolerated dose?
 •Should the dose or preparation be changed for a more balanced effect?
 •Are the right symptoms and time of day being targeted?
 •Has the patient become tolerant to the medication?
 •Does the patient have any life circumstances contributing to the poor response?
 •Have any comorbidities been missed?
 •Is the diagnosis correct?
Use of second-line medications (atomoxetine, guanfacine extended-  
release (ER), clonidine ER, viloxazine ER).
Augmenting agents (combine stimulants with other immediate 
release or ER stimulants, guanfacine ER or clonidine ER).
Use of other agents (off-label) under specialist advice and/or 
supervision."|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|10|287e5bd19dd9480ea503d44bd3e066fe

brain activity by providing patients with real-time feedback on their 
brainwave patterns through visual or auditory cues. Meta-analyses have 
shown small to medium effects of EEG neurofeedback in individuals 
with ADHD, that are inferior to the effects of pharmacotherapy226 –228. 
The effects of EEG neurofeedback are non-significant when analy -

is an FDA-approved treatment for ADHD, based on an RCT in 62 children with ADHD that showed improvement in symptoms, with a medium 
effect size, after 4 weeks of nightly TNS applications241.
Digital and virtual tools.  Digital health interventions (DHIs) for ADHD 
leverage consumer technology platforms (for example, computers, 
smartphones and wearable devices) providing therapeutic game-based 
products that deliver neurocognitive and behavioural interventions 
along with tracking and remote measurement technologies242. Digital 
interventions offer important opportunities to transform clinical 
care. First, they are highly scalable and can overcome many barriers to 
accessing treatment as they can be accessed any time and anywhere, 
and do not require highly trained therapists, even if adjunctive human 
support is offered. Second, therapy can be offered with high fidelity as 
the active intervention components are contained within the software. 
Third, DHIs can be used to collect important information to augment 
assessment and treatment response (for example, symptom ratings, medication adherence, psychoeducation and timing of doses).
Although the evidence base for digital interventions in ADHD is 
growing, the quality of many studies is low, and studies have shown"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|11|a4768eff012c4f99b5f75c73c0b7f87f
"Although the evidence base for digital interventions in ADHD is 
growing, the quality of many studies is low, and studies have shown 
inconsistent benefits on ADHD outcomes243. However, digital therapies 
targeting broader cognitive functions may have greater effects. A large 
RCT of a video game-like intervention targeting divided attention and 
cognitive control, played at home by children with ADHD for 25 min per 
day, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks, demonstrated a small, but significant, 
improvement on a neuropsychological measure of attention but a 
non-significant improvement in ADHD symptoms244. Central executive 
functioning training, another gamified treatment, has shown promise 
in an RCT for reducing symptoms of ADHD and improving academic 
achievement245 ,246. The most recent meta-analysis of computer-based 
cognitive training confirmed previous meta-analytical findings of no 
significant effects on ADHD symptoms when considering probably 
blinded raters247.
Quality of life
ADHD negatively affects various functional areas throughout develop -
ment, which can often lead to a negative self-perception in relation to a 
person’s place in life, considering the cultural and value systems to 
which that individual belongs. The accumulation of impairments leads 
to a low quality of life (QoL)248.
In youths, ADHD can lead to educational and occupational failure, 
peer conflicts and social exclusion, family conflict, teenage pregnancy"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|11|7adda781c1a54ffb9632cda98dabe179
"In youths, ADHD can lead to educational and occupational failure, 
peer conflicts and social exclusion, family conflict, teenage pregnancy 
and sexually transmitted diseases4. Psychosocial, school and emotional 
functioning are the QoL domains most frequently affected in youths 
with ADHD249. These impairments accumulate over time, reducing 
self-esteem and wellbeing and increasing the risks of suicidality249. The 
comorbidities of ADHD aggravate these outcomes43. In adults, ADHD 
impairs work functioning, relationship quality, financial stability and 
parenting skills250 ,251. These issues can affect QoL, which is further 
reduced with the continued risk of accidents and the emergence of 
adverse medical outcomes such as cardiometabolic disease53,56,70,252 
and premature death44. In adults, psychosocial domains of QoL and 
dysfunctional cognitive beliefs are common253– 255.
Measures to evaluate QoL or functional impairment in indi -
viduals with ADHD differ between children and adults. In children, 
a standard set of measures can be used to evaluate QoL, namely, 
the clinician-reported Developmental Disability–Children’s Global 
Assessment Scale (for overall functioning), the KIDSCREEN-10 (for 
family-related QoL and activities of daily living) and the Family Strain 
Index (for care-giver burden). Other commonly used measures are Intermediate

discontinuing medication reduce the QoL of youths with ADHD274. 
These findings could be explained by the additional substantial effect 
of CBT on QoL275 documented in a meta-analysis208.
Outlook
Although the knowledge base on ADHD provides a firm foundation 
for clinical practice, future research should also improve both knowl-
edge and clinical practice (Table 2). We need to learn more about the 
extent and effect of stigma on people with ADHD, and to improve strate -
gies to avoid stigma. Epidemiological studies, in particular prospective 
studies, will further our understanding of the aetiological links between 
ADHD and its mental and somatic comorbidities, which may lead to bet -
ter treatments for those with multiple diagnoses. Such studies will also 
improve our understanding of treatment discontinuity, longitudinal 
trajectories, key transitions and long-term outcomes, especially the 
impact of ADHD in older adults and the risks for mild cognitive impair -
ment and dementia. More work is needed in under-represented groups 
to reduce health-care disparities, improve health-care accessibility"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|12|31d79dba09b5475297d52c4db001a9b6
"ment and dementia. More work is needed in under-represented groups 
to reduce health-care disparities, improve health-care accessibility 
and better understand how culture moderates symptom expression and 
response to treatment.
Studies of mechanisms and pathophysiology have reached a turn -
ing point. Large collaborative studies have yielded clear evidence 
about the effect of genetic variants on ADHD and we are beginning to 
understand the subtle brain differences between individuals with and 
those without ADHD. Moreover, deep sequencing studies should find 
genetic variants that regulate the function of other genes or affect pro -
teins that are involved in the development or function of the brain. By 
better understanding the functional consequences of genetic variants, 
researchers aim to discover novel targets for ADHD medications276 ,277.
Although we know much about the impairments in ADHD, much 
less is known about potential assets and strengths associated with the 
disorder (although see ref. 278 ). Likewise, little is known about protec -
tive and resilience factors, both environmental and genomic279 ,280, that 
might improve outcomes in patients with ADHD.
Studies of environmental correlates of ADHD have lagged behind 
those of genetics due to the limits of epidemiology to prove causal links. Fruitful directions for environmental studies will be to use high-risk 
infant, sibling-control and in vitro fertilization designs108, test hypoth -"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|12|387caf651a7344c494e5cf26144c5f61
"infant, sibling-control and in vitro fertilization designs108, test hypoth -
eses about gene–environment interplay, and invest in the detection of 
resilience mechanisms. Epigenetics may clarify how putative environ -
mental causes are relevant to ADHD. Studies that track changes in brain 
structure and function throughout development will yield insights 
into developmental trajectories and reasons for the persistence of 
the disorder281.
Moreover, there is growing interest in developing objective 
methods for diagnosing ADHD and predicting treatment response282. 
Machine learning algorithms will be used to analyse multidomain data 
from medical records, objective behavioural measures, physiology, 
brain imaging and genomics, to find patterns that predict the onset and 
outcomes of ADHD. The use of polygenic risk scores as a predictor will 
increase as more data become available and methods are improved78,80. 
Given that the onset of ADHD is typically prior to the onset of its psychi -
atric and somatic comorbidities, more work should be done to predict 
which patients should be targeted for preventive efforts to eliminate 
or reduce the impact of these co-occurring conditions.
Future research will also continue to investigate personalized 
treatment approaches based on studies seeking a better understand-
ing of the heterogeneity of ADHD in terms of its aetiology, patho -
physiology and clinical expression. More stimulant and non-stimulant"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|12|0cb63cb26189424a93ffd17f003a10d7

physiology and clinical expression. More stimulant and non-stimulant 
medications will be developed, and learning how to best select and 
sequence treatments will be essential. Although response to ADHD 
medications is robust, there is considerable variability in response 
and tolerability, especially for non-stimulants, which have distinct 
profiles of responders and non-responders. Learning how to best match 
patients to treatments will become a research prioirty183 and methods 
to improve adherence to medication, which is poor283 –285, will greatly 
improve outcomes.
Skills training and CBT will be improved by studies that investigate

varied results due to the limited size and diversity of the trials. To gain 
a clearer understanding, it is essential to conduct larger RCTs that spe -
cifically focus on identifying the most effective treatment protocols 
for various age groups and clinical or cognitive subgroups within the 
ADHD population.
Lifestyle recommendations will become a component of multi-
modal treatment programmes for ADHD along with medication and 
behavioural interventions. We will see studies of neurotherapies, applications, wearables, gaming platforms and other digital tools 
aiming to reduce symptoms of ADHD and monitor symptoms during 
treatment. Future work on ADHD will be influenced by the neurodi -
versity framework that considers ADHD to be associated with dif -
ferences in brain development and cognitive style rather than being  
a disorder per se286.Well-designed studies will assess if changes in brain activity or 
structure following interventions could be used as objective measures 
of treatment response. Measurement-based care287 ,288 and the use of"|data_input/adhd_2/Faraone 2024 Disease Primers_ADHD.pdf|13|f061338be75d4cd9bb83e2a262e4f1a6
"structure following interventions could be used as objective measures 
of treatment response. Measurement-based care287 ,288 and the use of 
quality care metrics289 ,290 hold much promise but require standards 
for implementation. More research is needed to develop combination 
therapies that better address the range of impairments in ADHD and 
its comorbidities. Predictive modelling184 ,185 may help personalize 
treatments and optimize outcomes. More research is needed to find 
effective food interventions for ADHD and on the biological pathways 
involved (immune system, oxidative biology, brain plasticity and the microbiome–gut–brain axis).
All these innovative directions will benefit from the international 
and interdisciplinary resources and collaborations (see Supplementary 
Table 2) that have, during the past decade, clarified the aetiology of 
ADHD, generated hypotheses about mechanisms, refined its diagnosis, 
optimized treatment outcomes, and improved the QoL of patients with 
ADHD across the lifespan.

"International Consensus Statement of ADHD  
Methods  
 
Easy -to-Understand Summary of the Methods Section  
The International Consensus Statement on ADHD was updated to include new scientific findings from 
the past 20 years. This update was done by carefully reviewing and selecting high -quality studies.  
Expert Involvement  
A group of experts from different organizations that study and treat ADHD worked together on this 
project. These organizations include:  
• The World Federation of ADHD  
• European Network  for Hyperkinetic Disorders (Eunethydis)  
• The American Professional Society of ADHD and Related Disorders  
• The Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance  
• The Asian Federation of ADHD  
• The Latin American League of ADHD  
• The Australian ADHD Professionals Association  
• The Is raeli Society of ADHD  
• The Saudi ADHD Society  
• Neurodevelopmental Disorders Across Lifespan section of the European Psychiatric Association  
• The ADHD Guidelines Group of the Association of Medical Scientific Societies in Germany  
• The ADHD Network of European C ollege of Neuropsychopharmacology  
• The Chinese Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry  
• The ADHD Section of the World Psychiatric Association  
Finding the Right Studies  
To find the best studies, researchers looked at a large medical database called PubMed.  They used 
specific search terms to find:

"specific search terms to find:  
• Large Studies : These studies looked at ADHD in big groups of people, usually more than 2000 
participants.  
• Meta -Analyses : These studies combined results from many smaller studies to get more reliable 
conclusions."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|0|272c2be4fe21482eb6b1cedfa2a86e46
"They made sure to exclude studies that were just reviews or those with small sample sizes. They also 
avoided treatment studies that didn't compare ADHD treatments properly.  
Criteria for Including Studies  
To make sure the information was strong, they only use d studies that:  
• Had results from five or more smaller studies or included data from at least 2000 people.  
• Clearly showed how strong the effects of ADHD and its treatments were.  
They used specific terms to describe the strength of the effects:  
• Small Effect : Hard to notice in one person but important if it affects many people.  
• Medium Effect : Noticeable to someone paying close attention.  
• Large Effect : Clearly important and makes a big difference.  
By using these strict rules, the experts ensured that the  statements in the updated Consensus Statement 
were based on reliable and strong evidence. This helps reduce misunderstandings and the stigma 
around ADHD.  
A Brief History: ADHD is Not a New Disorder  
The concept of ADHD has been around for a long time, with  its symptoms being noted in medical 
literature for over two centuries. Although the term ""ADHD"" wasn't used back then, descriptions of 
behaviors that we now associate with ADHD were documented. Here are some key points from the early 
history of ADHD:  
1. 1775 : Melchior Adam Weikard, a German physician, was the first to write about a disorder that 
had symptoms similar to ADHD in a textbook."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|1|9cecb5514c2945d0b2f443f327fcbd22
"1. 1775 : Melchior Adam Weikard, a German physician, was the first to write about a disorder that 
had symptoms similar to ADHD in a textbook.  
2. 1798 : Alexander Crichton, a physician from the Royal College of Physicians in the UK, described 
a similar disorder in a me dical textbook.  
3. 1845 : Heinrich Hoffmann, who later became the head of the first psychiatric hospital in 
Frankfurt, Germany, wrote a children's book that described hyperactivity and attention deficits, 
showing ADHD -like behaviors.  
4. 1887 -1901 : Several French medical and educational writers, including Désiré -Magloire 
Bourneville, Charles Boulanger, Georges Paul -Boncour, and Jean Philippe, described behaviors 
that were similar to ADHD.  
5. 1902 : George Still, a physician in the UK, provided the first scientific jour nal description of the 
disorder.  
6. 1907 : Augusto Vidal Perera wrote the first Spanish book on child psychiatry, discussing the 
impact of inattention and hyperactivity among schoolchildren.  
7. 1917 : Spanish neurologist and psychiatrist Gonzalo Rodriguez -Lafora d escribed ADHD symptoms 
in children, suggesting they were due to a brain disorder with genetic origins."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|1|7de9a84e052247a5b4d6055ed1cf9396
"8. 1932 : Franz Kramer and Hans Pollnow from Germany described an ADHD -like syndrome and 
coined the term “hyperkinetic disorder,” later used by the World Hea lth Organization.  
9. 1937 : Charles Bradley in the USA discovered that amphetamine medication reduced ADHD -like 
symptoms.  
10. 1940s : Symptoms similar to ADHD in children were described as ""minimal brain dysfunction.""  
11. 1956 -1958 : Studies began to suggest that behavi ors related to minimal brain dysfunction could 
persist into adulthood.  
12. 1960s : The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved methylphenidate (Ritalin) for 
behavioral disorders in children.  
13. 1970s to Today : Diagnostic criteria for ADHD have evolved, based on  research showing that the 
diagnosis can predict treatment response, the clinical course of the disorder, and its family 
history.  
This historical perspective shows that ADHD has been recognized in various forms for a long time, 
highlighting its consistent presence across different eras and cultures.  
How is ADHD Diagnosed?  
ADHD is diagnosed through a comprehensive evaluation by a licensed clinician. This evaluation includes 
interviews with the parent or caregiver and the patient to document the criteria for ADHD. Here’s a 
simplified overview of the process:  
Key Steps in Diagnosis  
1. Professional Evaluation  
• Who Can Diagnose:  Only a licensed clinician, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or 
other qualified healthcare professional, can diagnose ADHD."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|2|e7ae0339bbdd4520a919bd1778d8dfb9
"other qualified healthcare professional, can diagnose ADHD.  
• Interview Process:  The clinician conducts interviews with the parent, caregiver, and/or 
the patient to understand their symptom s and how they affect daily life.  
2. Assessment Tools  
• Not Based on Tests:  ADHD cannot be diagnosed using rating scales, neuropsychological 
tests, or brain imaging alone. These tools can provide supportive information but are 
not definitive for diagnosis.  
• Deta iled History:  The clinician gathers a detailed history of the patient's behavior, 
development, and environment. This includes medical history, family history of mental 
health issues, academic performance, and social interactions.  
3. Criteria for Diagnosis  
• Duration and Settings:  Symptoms must be present for at least six months and occur in 
multiple settings, such as both at home and school."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|2|391e33c4abd549b0abc86d1664f16105
"• Impact on Life:  The symptoms must cause significant impairment in social, academic, or 
occupational functioning.  
• Early Onset:  Some symptoms must have been present before the age of 12.  
• Exclusion of Other Causes:  Other mental health disorders must be ruled out as the 
primary cause of the symptoms.  
4. Addressing Criticisms  
• Validity of Diagnosis:  ADHD is often criticized for bei ng a subjective diagnosis since it 
lacks a biological test. However, it meets standard criteria for the validity of a mental 
disorder because:  
• Agreement Among Professionals:  Well -trained professionals across different 
settings and cultures agree on the dia gnosis using well -defined criteria.  
• Predictive Value:  The diagnosis helps predict other problems the patient may 
have, future outcomes, response to treatments, and underlying causes 
indicated by genetics or brain imaging.  
5. Professional Guidelines  
• Endorsemen ts: Professional associations have developed and endorsed guidelines for 
diagnosing ADHD, ensuring a standardized approach across various healthcare settings.  
By following these steps, clinicians can accurately diagnose ADHD, helping ensure that individual s 
receive appropriate treatment and support for managing their symptoms .  
Diagnosing ADHD involves several important steps and criteria to ensure an accurate assessment.  
Criteria for Diagnosis  
• Symptoms:  The diagnosis requires symptoms of hyperactivity -impu lsivity and/or inattention"|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|3|13d8911d919f4361b3936c79d3d64d27
"Criteria for Diagnosis  
• Symptoms:  The diagnosis requires symptoms of hyperactivity -impu lsivity and/or inattention 
that are not appropriate for the child's age and have lasted at least six months.  
• Settings:  These symptoms must be present in more than one setting, such as both home and 
school.  
• Impairments:  The symptoms must cause significant p roblems in daily life.  
• Age of Onset:  Some of these symptoms should have been present in early childhood.  
• Exclusion of Other Disorders:  The symptoms should not be better explained by another mental 
disorder.  
Types of ADHD  
• Presentations:  ADHD can be categorized into three types: primarily inattentive, primarily 
hyperactive -impulsive, or combined.  
• Associated Issues:  Inattentive symptoms are  often linked to academic struggles and low self -
esteem, while hyperactive -impulsive symptoms can lead to peer rejection and risky behaviors."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|3|7308e76139b1473f863040342771a2c9
"ADHD in Intelligent Individuals  
• Intelligence:  ADHD can affect highly intelligent people too. Studies show that chi ldren with high 
IQs who have ADHD experience similar rates of learning disorders, psychiatric issues, and 
substance abuse as those with average or low IQs.  
Adolescence and Adulthood  
• Continuation:  Many individuals who were diagnosed with ADHD in childhood c ontinue to 
experience symptoms and impairments into adolescence and young adulthood.  
Importance of a Comprehensive Evaluation  
• Evaluation Process:  A thorough evaluation by a licensed clinician is crucial for an accurate 
diagnosis. This involves interviews w ith the patient and their caregivers, along with gathering 
detailed histories and possibly using standardized rating scales.  
This structured approach helps clinicians make a reliable diagnosis, ensuring that individuals with ADHD 
receive the appropriate su pport and treatment they need.  
How Common is ADHD?  
ADHD, or Attention -Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, is a condition that affects people all around the 
world. It is more frequently diagnosed in boys than in girls. Over the last thirty years, the actual num ber 
of people with ADHD hasn't really changed, but doctors have become better at recognizing and 
diagnosing it.  
Here are some important points:  
• About 5.9% of young people (kids and teenagers) have ADHD.  
• Studies have shown that this rate is pretty much the same no matter where you are in the world"|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|4|2f14afa43136499b9425ef85fdc531bd
"• Studies have shown that this rate is pretty much the same no matter where you are in the world 
– North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, or Oceania.  
• In adults, about 2.8% have ADHD. This percentage is lower than in kids because some people 
with ADHD as children no longer meet the full criteria fo r the disorder when they become 
adults.  
• ADHD is more common  in boys than in girls  and boys with ADHD are more likely than girls with 
ADHD to be referred for treatment.  
• In adults, about 2.5% have ADHD according to one analysis, while another estimated that 2.8% 
of adults have ADHD. This lower rate in adults compared to youths is consistent with findings 
that only about one in six youths with ADHD still meet full criteria for the disorder by age 25. 
About half of these adults show some ongoing symptoms, but n ot enough to meet the full 
criteria for ADHD.  
• In older adults, a study found that about 2.2% of people over 50 show symptoms of ADHD based 
on rating scales, but this drops to 1.5% when using stricter criteria. When looking at clinical 
diagnoses of ADHD, th e rate drops further to 0.2% for those over 50. Another study found that 
only 0.02% of those over 50 receive treatment for ADHD."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|4|9f925a8fccf84e178602b8689a9f54b8
"Even though the prevalence of ADHD (how common it is) hasn’t changed much, the number of 
diagnoses has gone up. This increase i s mostly because doctors and healthcare systems have gotten 
better at identifying and diagnosing ADHD.  
 
Genetic Causes of ADHD  
For most people with ADHD, a mix of genetic and environmental factors come together to cause the 
disorder. Environmental risks, such as things happening during pregnancy or early childhood, can play a 
big role. In rare cases, ADHD -like symptoms might come from severe neglect, a single genetic issue, or a 
head injury early in life.  
These findings help us underst and what might lead to ADHD, but they don't help diagnose it. While 
there's strong evidence that environmental factors are linked to ADHD, it's often hard to tell if these 
factors directly cause the disorder or if they are just related to genetic influence s. That's why we call 
these environmental factors ""correlates"" instead of direct causes. The genetic and environmental risks 
mentioned here can also be linked to other disorders, not just ADHD.  
ADHD is strongly influenced by genetics, meaning it often runs  in families. Studies of twins show that 
both genetic factors and the interplay  between genes and the environment play a major role in causing 
ADHD.  
Researchers have identified many genetic variants that increase the risk for ADHD. These genetic factors"|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|5|2e5d1eb7e6204199b8fe7b5533e54979
"ADHD.  
Researchers have identified many genetic variants that increase the risk for ADHD. These genetic factors 
are known as ""polygenic,"" meaning that many small genetic differences combine to affect the likelihood 
of developing the disorder. This polygenic risk can also influence related issues like anxiety and 
depression.  
Some cases of ADHD are caused by rare geneti c mutations or abnormalities in the chromosomes. For 
example, children with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder often have more rare genetic mutations 
compared to those without these conditions.  
Genetic studies show that ADHD shares genetic links with many o ther psychiatric and physical disorders, 
such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, conduct disorder, eating 
disorders, substance use disorders, migraines, and obesity. However, ADHD also has its own unique 
genetic risks . 
Large family studies indicate that ADHD shares genetic or familial causes with autoimmune diseases, 
certain birth defects, and intellectual disabilities. This means that the genetic factors influencing ADHD 
can also affect the risk of developing these ot her conditions.  
Environmental Correlates of ADHD: Exposure to Toxicants  
Research has found several environmental factors that might increase the risk of developing ADHD, 
especially exposure to certain toxic substances.   These have not been confirmed as causes of ADHD."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|5|92b97dea1e5a4db8b9c69a648e5e5854
"especially exposure to certain toxic substances.   These have not been confirmed as causes of ADHD.  
Studies show that higher levels of lead in the blood are linked to an increased risk of ADHD. For 
example, children with high lead levels are more likely to have ADHD compared to those with low lead 
levels ."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|5|da380d2d63eb42d9aedb1320e5c29738
"Prenatal exposure to smoking has been associated with a higher chance of children developing ADHD. 
However, this link may be influenced by genetic factors that make families more likely to both smoke 
and have ADHD.  
Exposure to secondhand smoke during chi ldhood also raises the likelihood of developing ADHD. Children 
who are exposed to more secondhand smoke are at a higher risk.  
Artificial food dyes have been linked to a slight increase in hyperactivity in some children. However, the 
effect is generally sma ll and varies between individuals.  
Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen (a common pain reliever) has been associated with a higher risk of 
ADHD in children. The more the mother used acetaminophen during pregnancy, the higher the risk.  
Exposure to certain che micals like phthalates, used in plastics, and organophosphate pesticides, used in 
agriculture, has been linked to an increased risk of ADHD. Children exposed to high levels of these 
chemicals are more likely to develop ADHD.  
Air pollution, specifically hig her levels of pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, has also 
been associated with an increased number of ADHD -related hospital admissions among adolescents.  
In summary, exposure to various environmental toxicants, such as lead, cigarette  smoke, certain 
chemicals, and air pollutants, can increase the risk of developing ADHD. These findings highlight the"|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|6|74cf5cb382be43f092d4819494a831a7
"chemicals, and air pollutants, can increase the risk of developing ADHD. These findings highlight the 
importance of reducing exposure to these harmful substances to help lower the risk of ADHD.  
Environmental Correlates of ADHD: Nutrient Def iciencies  
Research has found that certain nutrient deficiencies can be linked to ADHD.  
Studies have shown that children with ADHD often have lower levels of serum ferritin, a protein that 
stores iron, even though their overall iron levels are normal. This could affect their energy levels and 
brain function.  
Children with ADHD also tend to have lower levels of omega -3 fatty acids in their blood compared to 
children without ADHD. Omega -3s are important for brain health and development.  
Another study found tha t children whose mothers had low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy were 
more likely to develop ADHD. Vitamin D is crucial for brain development and overall health.  
Environmental Correlates of ADHD: Events During Pregnancy and Birth  
Research shows that c ertain events during pregnancy and birth can increase the risk of developing 
ADHD.  
Babies born very early (preterm) or with very low birth weight have a higher chance of having ADHD. 
One study found that these babies are three times more likely to develop ADHD. Another large study 
confirmed that lower birth weight is linked to a higher risk of ADHD.  
If a mother has high blood pressure during pregnancy, her child is more likely to develop ADHD. The risk"|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|6|37a975fec8494f3ba563ce29e89c9ed3
"If a mother has high blood pressure during pregnancy, her child is more likely to develop ADHD. The risk 
is higher if the baby is small for its gestational age and the mother has a condition called preeclampsia, 
which involves high blood pressure and other symptoms."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|6|3725425feeec4147b912cb15a1cf1fda
"Children born to mothers who were obese before pregnancy are more likely to develop ADHD. This risk 
is higher for children whose mothers were severely obese.  
Thyroid problems in mothers during pregnancy can also affect the risk. Both hyperthyroidism 
(overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) in pregnant women are slightly linked to 
a higher chance of their children developing ADHD.  
Environmental Correlates of ADHD: Deprivation, Stress, Infection, Poverty, and Trauma  
Research shows that various challenging life circumstances and experiences can increase the risk of 
developing ADHD.  
A study in Taiwan found that children who had a  specific type of viral infection (enterovirus) were 25% 
more likely to develop ADHD.  
Another study in Denmark showed that boys whose mothers experienced the loss of a close relative 
during pregnancy were twice as likely to develop ADHD.  
In the United Stat es, a study found that children who experienced sexual abuse or physical neglect had a 
higher chance of developing the inattentive type of ADHD.  
Lower family income is also linked to a higher risk of ADHD. This was found in studies from South Korea 
and Swe den, even after accounting for genetic and family factors.  
Other studies show that children who grow up in difficult family situations, such as having parents with 
mental disorders or criminal records, are more likely to develop ADHD. These challenging cir cumstances"|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|7|12445e8bde964e0d9223581f96e165da
"mental disorders or criminal records, are more likely to develop ADHD. These challenging cir cumstances 
can include being placed in foster care, living in low social class conditions, or experiencing severe 
marital discord in the family.  
Lastly, studies have shown that social disadvantages, like parents having low educational levels, being 
unemplo yed, or living in poverty, increase the risk of ADHD in children. The more these disadvantages 
accumulate, the higher the risk.  
In summary, difficult life circumstances and stressful events during childhood, such as infections, 
poverty, trauma, and family problems, can increase the risk of developing ADHD.  
What Have We Learned from Studying the Brains of People with ADHD?  
Research on the brains of people with ADHD has provided important insights into the disorder. There 
are two main types of studies: those that look at performance on psychological tests and those that 
examine brain structure and function using imaging techniques.  
First, studies on psychological tests show that people with ADHD often perform differently on tasks that 
measure mental processes.  For example, they may have lower scores on IQ tests and academic skills like 
reading, spelling, and arithmetic. They also tend to have more trouble with tasks that require abstract 
problem solving, working memory, focused attention, sustained attention, a nd verbal memory."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|7|3e74bd979ebf4d74b8ddfa16b9235714
"problem solving, working memory, focused attention, sustained attention, a nd verbal memory. 
Additionally, people with ADHD are more likely to make cognitive errors, prefer immediate rewards over 
larger delayed ones, and show more impulsive decision -making.  
Second, brain imaging studies have found small differences in brain struc ture and function between 
people with and without ADHD. These differences include slightly smaller brain volumes in certain areas,"|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|7|8690c73b7831497f8d5da5d77491cdc7
"such as the frontal, cingulate, and temporal regions, as well as the basal ganglia, amygdala, and 
hippocampus. Functional MRI  studies show that people with ADHD have less activation in brain regions 
involved in inhibitory control, like the right inferior frontal cortex and basal ganglia.  
Overall, while these brain differences are significant for understanding ADHD, they are not large enough 
to be used for diagnosing the disorder. Additionally, some of these brain differences may diminish or 
change as individuals with ADHD grow older. This research helps us understand how ADHD affects the 
brain, but it also highlights the need for  further studies to fully grasp the complex nature of the disorder.  
Performance Deficits in Psychological Processes  
Research has shown that people with ADHD often face challenges in various mental processes, 
impacting their daily functioning.  
Individuals w ith ADHD typically have slightly lower IQ scores compared to those without ADHD, affecting 
their academic performance. Studies indicate that they perform worse in reading, spelling, and 
arithmetic. However, in adults, the IQ deficits are generally small an d not very significant.  
People with ADHD struggle with abstract problem solving and working memory, which means they have 
difficulty handling tasks that require holding and manipulating information in their mind. They also have"|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|8|c9789d7babd8471283ce2376c26622dc
"difficulty handling tasks that require holding and manipulating information in their mind. They also have 
trouble focusing their atten tion on a specific task (focused attention) and keeping their attention 
sustained over time (sustained attention). Additionally, their ability to remember verbal information 
(verbal memory) is often impaired. These individuals are also more prone to making  cognitive errors 
known as ""rule violations,"" where they fail to follow established rules or guidelines.  
A notable characteristic of ADHD is the tendency to prefer smaller immediate rewards over larger 
delayed ones. This behavior, known as impulsive decisi on-making, reflects a difficulty in delaying 
gratification. Individuals with ADHD are also more likely to make risky decisions, which can lead to 
negative consequences.  
A comprehensive analysis that included 34 meta -analyses found that people with ADHD hav e moderate 
impairments in several cognitive domains. These include working memory, reaction time variability, 
response inhibition (the ability to suppress inappropriate actions), planning, and organization. These 
impairments are generally more pronounced i n children and adolescents than in adults, indicating that 
cognitive deficits related to ADHD may improve with age but can still persist into adulthood.  
Specific studies have shown that children with ADHD have moderate impairments in working memory,"|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|8|07f7e1a46cbd43a682309f40b30ea913
"Specific studies have shown that children with ADHD have moderate impairments in working memory, 
which tend to improve as they get older. Additionally, there are no significant differences in ADHD 
symptoms between boys and girls, indicating that both sexes experience similar cognitive challenges.  
Cognitive training has shown some promise in improving certai n aspects of cognitive function in young 
children with ADHD. For instance, cognitive training programs have been found to moderately improve 
working memory and inhibitory control (the ability to control impulsive responses) in preschoolers.  
In summary, ADH D affects various aspects of cognitive function, including problem -solving, memory, 
attention, and decision -making. These cognitive impairments can vary in severity but are generally more 
noticeable in younger individuals. While some cognitive deficits may  improve over time, many 
individuals with ADHD continue to experience challenges into adulthood."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|8|5029bedbbdd0410486fd4eba643a5af1
"Differences in the Brain Found by Neuroimaging Studies  
Research using brain scans has found some small differences in the brains of people with ADHD 
compared to those without the disorder.  
Studies using MRI scans show that children with ADHD have slightly smaller brain areas in regions like 
the frontal, cingulate, and temporal lobes. These children also have smaller structures in the brain like 
the bas al ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus. However, these differences are very small and are not 
seen in teenagers or adults with ADHD.  
Comparisons between people with ADHD and those with other disorders show that ADHD is linked to 
reduced gray matter in areas  like the basal ganglia and insula. For instance, people with ADHD have 
smaller hippocampal volumes compared to those with obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) and smaller 
overall brain volume compared to those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and OCD.  
Functional MRI (fMRI) studies, which look at brain activity, show that people with ADHD have less 
activation in brain regions responsible for controlling impulses, like the right inferior frontal cortex and 
basal ganglia. These areas do not work as strongly  during tasks requiring focus and control.  
Another type of brain scan, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), found differences in the white matter of 
people with ADHD. White matter is important for connecting different parts of the brain. The"|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|9|fb08f43aa67f40f0998cef6a5af49b6c
"people with ADHD. White matter is important for connecting different parts of the brain. The 
differences suggest  that the connections between the two sides of the brain, especially in areas 
important for attention and perception, might not work as well in people with ADHD.  
In summary, brain imaging studies have found small structural and functional differences in th e brains of 
people with ADHD. These differences are mainly in areas related to attention and control. However, 
these changes are not big enough to be used to diagnose ADHD on their own."|data_input/adhd_2/Simplified International Consensus Statement.pdf|9|1a0266a16dfe423eb73b5a5b28539a1a
